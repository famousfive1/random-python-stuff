L657410 +++$+++ u8936 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ TEEMO +++$+++ Elves!  They're always tormenting babies.  They make them cry and take their tears.
L657670 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Here.  Hold her.
L657669 +++$+++ u8935 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ SORSHA +++$+++ I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.

L657665 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ I don't know much about him.

L657661 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.
L657660 +++$+++ u8935 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ SORSHA +++$+++ I changed her already!

L659271 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ You might want to pass it along to Mac.
L659270 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ Johnny –
L659269 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.
L659268 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ How bad did Mac get you? We figured pretty bad.
L659267 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ You made a mistake, Paul. You shouldn't have taken Elton out.
L658965 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Just us.
L658964 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ Who else knows?
L658963 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days.
L658962 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ What's your first move?
L658961 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it.  I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you.
L658960 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
L658959 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
L658958 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Just us.
L658957 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ Who else knows?
L658956 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
L658955 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
L658954 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
L658849 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ Well, anyway, don't get crazy.  I'll do something for Zenovich's wife.

L658847 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde – what's-her-name – come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
L658846 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.
L658845 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.
L658844 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
L658843 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
L658842 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ You're still convinced there's a link to the department?
L658841 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Maybe.
L658840 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ You know who?
L658839 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Maybe.

L658948 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
L658947 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Because – somehow – they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.
L658946 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ But why would they murder...
L658945 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.

L658938 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.
L658937 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Oh? Anything else?
L658936 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ She thinks you should get married and have children of your own. Instead of trying to be a father to hers. Except she thinks you're afraid of the responsibility.
L658935 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ No.
L658934 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Your sister said you don't have a family?
L658932 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.
L658931 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ But not a good tired.
L658929 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I would not be too sure.
L658928 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ They kid a lot.
L658927 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ No you're not –  You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
L658926 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Look, I'm genuinely sorry...

L658924 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ We do not go into your courts.
L658923 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.
L658922 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Yes. And I also want to leave this city.
L658921 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Whacking?
L658920 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
L658919 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Now what's the problem?
L658862 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.
L658861 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ What was that?
L658859 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ It's not a joke.
L658858 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
L658857 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
L658856 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
L658855 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You have no right to keep us here.
L658854 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.

L658809 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ There'll be another train.  The man who was killed tonight was a policeman, Sam. It's my job to find out who did it. I want you to tell me everything you saw when you went in there.
L658808 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Samuel. Samuel Lapp.  But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
L658807 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name?

L659143 +++$+++ u8939 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Listen, Johnny, don't do anything stupid. You couldn't get within a mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay put... Stay in touch – I'll let you know when maybe it makes sense.
L659142 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ I'm coming.
L659141 +++$+++ u8939 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.

L658977 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.

L658975 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar, I want you to lose it for me, Now. Tonight.

L658816 +++$+++ u8938 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ BOOK +++$+++ Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he looked like?
L658815 +++$+++ u8939 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I didn't even know about it.

L659218 +++$+++ u8939 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I admit I don't know where he is.
L659217 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ You admit you're lying?
L659216 +++$+++ u8939 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Probably.
L659215 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ You'd lie to protect him.
L659214 +++$+++ u8939 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Wrong.
L659213 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ You know where he is.
L659077 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ But... if you had to guess?
L659076 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I don't know where he is.
L659075 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him –
L659074 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
L659073 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
L659072 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know – anybody who knows John – knows that's a goddamn lie!
L659071 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position.
L659069 +++$+++ u8947 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SCHAEFFER +++$+++ Not yet.
L659068 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Did you find him?
L658917 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Listen, I don't know what's going on or how you got mixed up with him, but don't you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around, okay?
L658916 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way.  But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.
L658915 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ No? Why not?
L658914 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
L658913 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ God, Fred...
L658912 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
L658911 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ What's so funny?
L658900 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first.  Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit.
L658899 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
L658898 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Just a minute. I'll pour you some coffee.
L658897 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like John.
L658896 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!
L658895 +++$+++ u8940 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You didn't have to...
L658894 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Good morning.

L659211 +++$+++ u8941 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELI +++$+++ No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
L659210 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I will be the judge of that.
L659209 +++$+++ u8941 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELI +++$+++ You are acting like one!
L659208 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I am not a child.
L659207 +++$+++ u8941 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELI +++$+++ Do not make light of it, Rachel. They can do it... quick! Like that! And then... then I can not sit at table with you. I can not take a thing from your hand. I... I can not go with you to meeting!  Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go too far! Dear child!
L659206 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ That is idle talk.
L659205 +++$+++ u8941 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELI +++$+++ No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!
L659204 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I have committed no sin.
L659203 +++$+++ u8941 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELI +++$+++ Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?
L659202 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I have done nothing against the ordnung.
L659201 +++$+++ u8941 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELI +++$+++ How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?
L659188 +++$+++ u8941 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELI +++$+++ Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how good a carpenter.
L659187 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Eli, John is a carpenter.  As well as being a fine policeman.

L659024 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
L659023 +++$+++ u8941 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELI +++$+++ Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws –
L659015 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I know.
L659014 +++$+++ u8941 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ ELI +++$+++ That has no place in this house.

L658889 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ They are English. They don't understand.
L658888 +++$+++ u8946 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ I don't want to stay here.
L658828 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ No... No. It is just the English way.
L658827 +++$+++ u8946 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ SAMUEL +++$+++ Momma... are they angry with us.
L658796 +++$+++ u8945 +++$+++ m609 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.

L660491 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
L660490 +++$+++ u8948 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --
L660483 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ No --
L660482 +++$+++ u8948 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.
L660481 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ But I did leave you, Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble.  And I tried to get back for days and days.
L660477 +++$+++ u8948 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ Yes, darling.
L660476 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
L660475 +++$+++ u8948 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
L660474 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ -- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --
L659471 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ You wicked old witch!  Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto!  Don't let her take him -- please!
L659470 +++$+++ u8948 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ Dorothy!
L659442 +++$+++ u8948 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ Now, you just help us out today, and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
L659441 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ No --
L659440 +++$+++ u8948 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
L659439 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto?  She said she was gonna --
L659385 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh -- all right.
L659384 +++$+++ u8948 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ Dorothy!  Dorothy!  We're busy!
L659383 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
L659382 +++$+++ u8948 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ Seventy --  Dorothy, please!
L659379 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, but Aunt Em, she hit him over the --
L659378 +++$+++ u8948 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
L659377 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
L659376 +++$+++ u8948 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
L659375 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Aunt Em!
L659465 +++$+++ u8948 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ Now, we can't go against the law, Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go.
L659464 +++$+++ u8962 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ UNCLE HENRY +++$+++ Uhh -- yeah --
L659390 +++$+++ u8962 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ UNCLE HENRY +++$+++ Yes.
L659389 +++$+++ u8948 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ Oh, I hope we got them in time.
L659388 +++$+++ u8962 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ UNCLE HENRY +++$+++ Yes.
L659387 +++$+++ u8948 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
L659386 +++$+++ u8962 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ UNCLE HENRY +++$+++ Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.
L659431 +++$+++ u8948 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ Well, don't start posing for it now.  Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.
L659430 +++$+++ u8952 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ HICKORY +++$+++ All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --
L659429 +++$+++ u8948 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!
L659428 +++$+++ u8952 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ HICKORY +++$+++ Well, Dorothy was walking along the --
L659427 +++$+++ u8948 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
L659426 +++$+++ u8952 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ HICKORY +++$+++ Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white --
L659605 +++$+++ u8949 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ BARRISTER +++$+++ You'll be hist...
L659604 +++$+++ u8955 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ From now on you'll be history

L659595 +++$+++ u8949 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ BARRISTER +++$+++ If any!
L659594 +++$+++ u8955 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants!
L659589 +++$+++ u8949 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ BARRISTER +++$+++ Is morally, ethic'ly
L659588 +++$+++ u8955 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ If she?
L659587 +++$+++ u8949 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ BARRISTER +++$+++ If she...
L659586 +++$+++ u8955 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ To see?
L659585 +++$+++ u8949 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ BARRISTER +++$+++ But we've got to verify it legally To see...
L659584 +++$+++ u8955 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ As Mayor of the Munchkin City In the County of the Land of Oz I welcome you most regally
L660354 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ You are?
L660353 +++$+++ u8957 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ OZ'S VOICE +++$+++ Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.
L660352 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Who are you?
L660351 +++$+++ u8957 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ OZ'S VOICE +++$+++ ... -- Oz -- has spoken!
L660342 +++$+++ u8957 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ OZ'S VOICE +++$+++ Do you presume to criticize the....
L660341 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!
L660334 +++$+++ u8957 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ OZ'S VOICE +++$+++ Not so fast!  Not....
L660333 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Yes, sir.  So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
L660332 +++$+++ u8957 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ OZ'S VOICE +++$+++ ...resourceful!
L660330 +++$+++ u8957 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ OZ'S VOICE +++$+++ Oh ....
L660329 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
L660328 +++$+++ u8957 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ OZ'S VOICE +++$+++ ...have you come back?
L660087 +++$+++ u8957 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ OZ'S VOICE +++$+++ The Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz!
L660086 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard!
L660085 +++$+++ u8957 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ OZ'S VOICE +++$+++ Tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that? Our echo - echo - echo.
L660084 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Our echo.
L660440 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Goodbye, folks!
L660439 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh --
L660438 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
L660437 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!
L660427 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Times being what they were, I accepted the job, -- retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick get-away.  And in that balloon, my dear Dorothy, you and I will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum!
L660426 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Ohhh!
L660425 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Frightened?  You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.  I was petrified.  Then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!
L660361 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh ....
L660360 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so.  I'm a humbug!
L660357 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ No, I'm afraid it's true. There's no other Wizard except me.
L660356 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I don't believe you!
L660355 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Uhhhh -- yes...
L659423 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Yes, I'm all right.  Oh -- I fell in and -- and Zeke --
L659422 +++$+++ u8952 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ HICKORY +++$+++ Are you all right, Dorothy?
L659421 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh!  Oh, Zeke!  Help!  Help me, Zeke!  Get me out of here!  Help!
L659415 +++$+++ u8952 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ HICKORY +++$+++ Now what happened? I'll bet Hunk did that.
L659414 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Hickory!
L659413 +++$+++ u8952 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ HICKORY +++$+++ Who did it? Now wait a minute.
L659412 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh!
L659411 +++$+++ u8952 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ HICKORY +++$+++ Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
L659410 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ This?
L659409 +++$+++ u8952 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ HICKORY +++$+++ Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
L659408 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
L659407 +++$+++ u8952 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ HICKORY +++$+++ Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.
L660212 +++$+++ u8963 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WITCH +++$+++ Catch him, you fool!
L660211 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Run, Toto, run!
L660208 +++$+++ u8963 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WITCH +++$+++ No!  Fool, that I am!  I should have remembered -- those slippers will never come off, as long as...
L660207 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
L660206 +++$+++ u8963 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WITCH +++$+++ Ahh!  Ah!
L660205 +++$+++ u8963 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WITCH +++$+++ That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.
L660204 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
L660203 +++$+++ u8963 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WITCH +++$+++ Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
L660202 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
L660201 +++$+++ u8963 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WITCH +++$+++ Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
L660200 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, please give me back my dog!
L660199 +++$+++ u8963 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WITCH +++$+++ All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
L660198 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!
L659620 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ No -- No!  It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!....
L659619 +++$+++ u8963 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WITCH +++$+++ ...didn't you?
L660472 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.
L660471 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ And think to yourself -- "There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home."
L660470 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
L660469 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Yes, I'm ready now.
L660468 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
L660467 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ Are you ready now?
L660462 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, dear -- that's too wonderful to be true! Oh, it's -- it's going to be so hard to say goodbye.  I love you all, too.  Goodbye, Tin Man.  Oh, don't cry.  You'll rust so dreadfully.  Here -- here's your oil-can. Goodbye.
L660461 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ Whenever you wish.
L660460 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, now?
L660459 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ Toto, too.
L660458 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ ...Toto, too?
L660448 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I have?
L660447 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
L660446 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me?
L659644 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ It's always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road.
L659643 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ But, how do I start for Emerald City?
L659642 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
L659641 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ No, I'm afraid I didn't.
L659640 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
L659639 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ The Wizard of Oz?  Is he good or is he wicked?
L659638 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
L659637 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
L659636 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
L659615 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.
L659614 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I thought you said she was dead.
L659565 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ The little people who live in this land -- it's Munchkinland, and you are their national heroine, my dear.  It's all right -- you may all come out and thank her. It's all right now - you may all come out.
L659564 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh.  But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
L659563 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.
L659557 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
L659556 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Toto's my dog.

L660489 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ But you couldn't have been, could you?

L659517 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Me?
L659516 +++$+++ u8958 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.

L659499 +++$+++ u8958 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Do you know any?  Oh, you mean the thing -- Yes, well, I -- I never do anything without consulting my crystal first. Let's....
L659498 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?

L659496 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ No, they won't - honestly.

L659494 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.

L659486 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
L659485 +++$+++ u8958 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ No, no --  now don't tell me.  They -- they don't understand you at home.  They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
L659484 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Why --
L659483 +++$+++ u8958 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
L659482 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ How did you guess?
L659481 +++$+++ u8958 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ PROFESSOR +++$+++ Let's see -- you're -- you're travelling in disguise. No, that's not right.  I -- you're -- you're going on a visit.  No, I'm wrong. That's...You're -- running away.

L659472 +++$+++ u8956 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ MISS GULCH +++$+++ Here!  I've got an order!  Let me have...
L659469 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, no, no!  I won't let you take him!  You go away, you....!  Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
L659468 +++$+++ u8956 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ MISS GULCH +++$+++ Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
L659467 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ No --
L659466 +++$+++ u8956 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ MISS GULCH +++$+++ Now you're seeing reason.
L659458 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Destroyed?  Toto?  Oh, you can't!  You mustn't! Auntie Em!  Uncle Henry!  You won't let her, will you?
L659457 +++$+++ u8956 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ MISS GULCH +++$+++ That dog's a menace to the community.  I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.
L660464 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh --  Goodbye, Lion.  You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.
L660463 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.
L660405 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Look -- it ticks!
L660404 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ ...yes.
L660403 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Yes...!
L660402 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Ahh --- Oh, it ticks!  Listen!
L660337 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ You've had plenty of time already!
L660336 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.
L660279 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I knew you would!
L660278 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Dorothy!
L660156 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Now come on - you're acting silly -- 
L660155 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh! Something bit me, too!
L660147 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh!  Oh, Tin Man!   Oh!
L660146 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ No.  Why only --  Oh --
L660070 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?
L660069 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Oh, he's just ascared again.
L659992 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh --
L659991 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Can't that female take no for an answer?
L659881 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I'm sure he could give you some courage.
L659880 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ And him a brain.
L659853 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ It-it-it-it - it's a huge one!
L659852 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ What sort of an animal is that?
L659851 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ And bears!
L659835 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh --
L659834 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ We might.
L659825 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Still, I wish I could remember.   But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.  We know each other now, don't we?
L659824 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
L659811 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh-oh-
L659810 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!
L659809 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh --
L659808 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh! Oh!
L659807 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Oh - I'll get it!
L659806 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
L659805 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
L659804 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
L659803 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Oh! They're - they're gone now.
L659793 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Ohh -- what's that? Oh --
L659792 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
L659791 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
L659788 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.
L659787 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
L659786 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
L659785 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
L659778 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ All hollow.  Oh --
L659777 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh --
L659772 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh --!

L659770 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Well, you're perfect now.
L659769 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ ...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid.  And I've been that way ever since.
L659768 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Oh -- well, about a year ago -- I was chopping that tree -- minding my own business -- when suddenly it started to rain....
L659767 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?
L659766 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh ---
L659765 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ ...Oh, did that hurt?
L659764 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Oh --

L660465 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
L660444 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, that's very kind of you -- but this could never be like Kansas.  Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now.  Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do?

L660164 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.
L660160 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
L660159 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
L660138 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh --

But I could show my prowess -- Be a lion not a mou-ess -- If I only had the nerve I'm afraid there's no denyin' I'm just a dande-lion -- A fate I don't deserve. I'd be brave as a blizzard --
L659886 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh.
L659885 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ ...has been simply unbearable.
L659873 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ You're right -- I am a coward.
L659872 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
L659871 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nose bleeding?
L659870 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --
L659869 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ No, but you tried to.
L659868 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ What -- what did you do that for?  I didn't bite him.
L659425 +++$+++ u8953 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ HUNK +++$+++ What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
L659424 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am!
L659406 +++$+++ u8953 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ HUNK +++$+++ Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
L659405 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
L659404 +++$+++ u8953 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ HUNK +++$+++ Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
L659403 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I have so got brains.
L659402 +++$+++ u8953 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ HUNK +++$+++ Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch.  Think you didn't have any brains at all.
L660304 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Help! I'm burning!  I'm burning!  I'm burning!  Help! Help! Help!
L660303 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
L660302 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ No -- No -- No -- No!
L660158 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Did you just hear what I just heard?
L660157 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Oh, come on now - everybody -- 
L660149 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Oh -- are you -- are you all right?
L660148 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh -- Oh --
L660058 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh -- and I was so happy!  I thought I was on my way home!
L660057 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
L660056 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh --
L659999 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!
L659998 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Dear, whatever shall we do?
L659943 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --
L659942 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ -- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
L659941 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him up.
L659940 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Yes -- there --
L659937 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh --
L659936 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ It does help.  Dorothy, you're waking up!
L659914 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto!
L659913 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ ...along.
L659879 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
L659878 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
L659833 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Do -- do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?
L659832 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
L659831 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I don't like this forest!  It's -- it's dark and creepy!
L659823 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ I don't see how.  You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
L659822 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I?
L659819 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?
L659818 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ ...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
L659790 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
L659789 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
L659760 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Yes --- there.
L659759 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ The other side....
L659758 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Here -- here --
L659757 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ He said his mouth.
L659754 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
L659753 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Oil can what?
L659749 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Yes.  Oh -- look --
L659748 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ What?
L659747 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin!
L659746 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh --
L659745 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Hooray!  I guess that did it!  Help yourself.
L659735 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm!
L659734 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
L659726 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ To Oz!
L659725 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ To Oz?
L659724 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
L659723 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
L659722 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard!
L659720 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you?
L659719 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I don't blame you for that.
L659718 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
L659717 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
L659716 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Yes -- that's true.
L659715 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
L659714 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
L659713 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Um-hmm.
L659712 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ You're going to see a Wizard?
L659711 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
L659710 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Where's Kansas?
L659709 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Um-hmm.
L659708 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ They would?
L659707 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
L659695 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
L659694 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Did I scare you?
L659693 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
L659692 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ ...free!
L659691 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ My, it's good to be....
L659690 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Ohhh --
L659689 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
L659688 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh -- does it hurt you?
L659687 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Whhhooops!  Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!
L659686 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Ohh!
L659685 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Ohhhh --
L659684 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ ...yes.
L659680 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Oh, that's very kind of you -- very kind.
L659679 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
L659678 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Down?  No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --
L659661 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ It's pleasant down that way, too.
L659660 +++$+++ u8950 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ ...don't talk.
L659632 +++$+++ u8963 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WITCH +++$+++ Very well -- I'll bide my time -- and as for you, my fine lady, it's true, I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like, but just try to stay out of my way....
L659631 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ Oh, rubbish!  You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
L659630 +++$+++ u8963 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WITCH +++$+++ You stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well!
L659626 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ It's too late!  There they....
L659625 +++$+++ u8963 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WITCH +++$+++ The ruby slippers!  What have you done with them? Give them back to me, or I'll ---
L659623 +++$+++ u8963 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WITCH +++$+++ The slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
L659622 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ ...ting the ruby slippers?
L659618 +++$+++ u8963 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WITCH +++$+++ You stay out of this! I'm here for vengeance! So it was you, was it? You killed her,....
L659617 +++$+++ u8951 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ GLINDA +++$+++ Leave her alone!
L659616 +++$+++ u8963 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WITCH +++$+++ Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
L660422 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ It did?
L660421 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ ...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.
L660415 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
L660414 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Dorothy next!
L660413 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Ah --
L660412 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Yeah.
L660384 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me.
L660383 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Real courage. That's what we want.
L660359 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Yeah!
L660358 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ You humbug!
L660299 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ This way!  Come on!
L660298 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Where -- where do we go now?
L660272 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh!
L660271 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Stop pushing!
L660260 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
L660259 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Come on -- I've got another idea.
L660248 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Now...
L660247 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Up!
L660240 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy -- Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart.  I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.  There's only one thing I want you fellows to do.
L660239 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ That's right.
L660238 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
L660237 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Yes, you.
L660236 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Yeah. Me?
L660235 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ And you're going to lead us.
L660234 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Fine.  He's got a plan
L660233 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ I've got a plan how to get in there.
L660189 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Don't stand there talking!  Put me together! We've got to find Dorothy!
L660188 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ They sure knocked the stuffings out of you, didn't they?
L660083 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ What was that?
L660082 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Here --   Come on.
L660081 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ I -- Oh --
L660080 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Oh, you did it yourself!
L660079 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Somebody pulled my tail.
L660078 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ What happened?
L660068 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ What's the matter?
L660067 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Wait a minute, fellahs.  I was just thinkin'.  I really don't want to see the Wizard this much.  I better wait for you outside.
L660062 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ I don't know.
L660061 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Who at?
L660060 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Would...would it do any good if I roared?
L660045 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
L660044 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ What if it were a brontosaurus?
L659925 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Don't you start it, too!
L659924 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.
L660379 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Not nohow!
L660378 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ You don't get around us that easy!
L660270 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Don't push!
L660269 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ ...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!
L660263 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Yeah.
L660262 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Where do we go now?
L660246 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ You don't neither --
L660245 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ No?  Now, wait a minute.
L660227 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ I hope your tail holds out. Oh --
L660226 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ ...I -- I -- I hope my strength holds out.
L660218 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Yeah --
L660217 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.
L660192 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Oh, poor Dorothy. We may never see her again.
L660191 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
L660190 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.
L660172 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Whozat?
L660171 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Whozat?
L660170 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ It's a whatzis?
L660169 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ It's a whatzis.
L660154 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Hold still - hold still --
L660153 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away! 
L660135 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ She - she can have my Witch Remover.
L660134 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with.
L660039 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Imposserous!
L660038 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Not even a rhinoceros?
L659920 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!
L659919 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ Dorothy!
L659877 +++$+++ u8954 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ LION +++$+++ That doesn't do any good -- I'm afraid of 'em.
L659876 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Why don't you try counting sheep?

L660193 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Who do you suppose they were? And where did they take her? A fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this!
L660187 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Well, that's you all over.
L660186 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!
L660185 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
L660184 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
L660168 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ It's a whozis?
L660167 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ It's a whozis.

L659928 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Let's.
L659927 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ I don't think I could, but we could try.
L659926 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Oh!  We ought to try and carry Dorothy.
L659923 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!
L659922 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Oh - oh, poor Dorothy!
L659918 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Dorothy!
L659917 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Hey, Dorothy!
L659909 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Emerald City!
L659908 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
L659907 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Oh!  Oh, come on, come on!
L659906 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Hurry -- hurry --

L659892 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ A heart --
L659891 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Then I'm sure to get a brain --
L659889 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ I'd be clever as a gizzard --
L659888 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ I'd be gentle as a lizard --
L659837 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
L659836 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Animals that -- that eat straw?
L659829 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ To Oz!
L659828 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ To Oz?
L659827 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ We do.
L659826 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ That's right.
L659821 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ No, sir!
L659820 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ No, sir!
L659802 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart of not.  Bee-hive -- bah!  Let her try and make a bee-hive out of me! You know -- Hmm? What's that?
L659801 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ I'm not afraid of her.  I'll see you get safely to the Wizard now, whether I get a brain or not!  Stuff a mattress with me! Hah!
L659774 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
L659773 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Beautiful!  What an echo!
L660392 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Well, you can't.  As for you, my fine friend -- you're a victim of disorganized thinking.  You are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger, you have no courage.  You're confusing courage with wisdom.  Back where I come from, we have men who are called heroes.  Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city.  And they have no more courage than you have.  But! They have one thing that you haven't got! A medal!  Therefore -- for meritorious....
L660391 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ How can I ever thank you enough?
L660388 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ Th.D.?
L660387 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.
L660381 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ You promised us real things -- a real...
L660380 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Well --
L660373 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Well, I --
L660372 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ -- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
L660371 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Well, I --
L660370 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
L660369 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Well, I --
L660368 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ What about us?
L660367 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Yes.
L660366 +++$+++ u8959 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ SCARECROW +++$+++ It makes you nervous?
L660365 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!
L660436 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Help!
L660435 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ -- Ruined my exit!
L660434 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Oh!  Help me! The balloon's going up!
L660433 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
L660432 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ Stop that dog!
L660398 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Yes -- ....
L660397 +++$+++ u8960 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ TIN MAN +++$+++ But I still want one.
L660396 +++$+++ u8964 +++$+++ m610 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart.
L663196 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ So isn’t it time you unwrapped your present?
L663195 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I love Christmas in Turkey.
L663192 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ We can’t.
L663191 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ We’ve got to get out.
L663180 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Count to twenty.  I’ll be there.
L663179 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ But what if...
L663178 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Count to twenty.  When you get to twenty open the hatch.  It can only be opened for a few seconds or we’ll sink.
L663171 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Just wanted to put him on edge...
L663170 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ What kind of bikes did you ride?
L663169 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Like riding a bike.
L663168 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ Do you know what you’re doing?
L663167 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ He’s going to insert the plutonium.
L663166 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ He’s sealed himself in.
L663156 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ We go down to the torpedo bay.
L663155 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ Is there another way?
L663103 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ If I don’t get to the Boa before he gets to Maiden’s Tower, M is dead.
L663102 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ Zukovsky...
L663073 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Elektra would control it all.
L663072 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ The King pipeline.
L663071 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
L663070 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe...
L663067 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Made to look just like an accident.
L663066 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  He’s not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub’s reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
L663065 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Nuclear.
L662988 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now.  And M’s life is part of the bet.
L662987 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ What is it?
L662979 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I was hoping you could tell me.
L662978 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
L662977 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Makes her look even more innocent.
L662976 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.
L662975 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Elektra King.
L662974 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ Who’s she?
L662973 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ It’s part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
L662972 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ What the hell are you talking about?
L662971 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I did kill us. She thinks we’re dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
L662970 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
L662953 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ It’s a bomb alright. We’re still dead if the trigger charge goes off...
L662952 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Then it’s no longer a bomb?
L662951 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ The plutonium is missing.  They’ve taken the core!
L662945 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Alright then, brunch.
L662944 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
L662943 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?
L662880 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ With this?
L662879 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ They won’t get far. Every warhead has a locator card.  A Miratom device.  Emits a high-pitched signal on Russian emergency frequencies. We can track the bomb.
L662877 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Bond --
L662876 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ So who are you?
L662875 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Shame you had to spot I wasn’t the real thing.
L662865 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Here’s your imposter. He’s paid off the men on the plane outside.  They’re not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, they’re flying it wherever he tells them.
L662864 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ He is an impostor.  There’s no Davidov at Miratom.
L662836 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ The soldiers may give you a hard time. Whatever. If we weren’t around, they’d have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides, rotting in the sun.
L662835 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Couldn’t make it. Splitting headache.
L662834 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ What happened to Len Tashka?
L662833 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Don’t know any doctor jokes.
L662832 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, I’ve heard them all.
L662831 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
L662830 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ You new?
L662605 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I could come for a second opinion?
L662604 +++$+++ u8967 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ DOCTOR GREATREX +++$+++ ...yes?...
L662603 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Perhaps after this ... test?
L662602 +++$+++ u8967 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ DOCTOR GREATREX +++$+++ Then maybe I’d be... open to that.
L662598 +++$+++ u8967 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ DOCTOR GREATREX +++$+++ James.  It wouldn’t really be...
L662597 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ It’s just a scratch.
L662596 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
L662595 +++$+++ u8967 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ DOCTOR GREATREX +++$+++ Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It won’t just be two weeks out of action.
L662921 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Is maybe...the inside woman.
L662920 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ The inside man?
L662919 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ They’re getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I can’t help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
L662918 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
L662917 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ The report King bought. It’s a manual. Renard’s men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.
L662651 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ The worm on the hook again.
L662650 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasn’t completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
L662647 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ He’s not through yet. Renard doesn’t blow up five million dollars unless he knows there’s more coming in. He’s working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline.  And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.
L662646 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
L662645 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ ‘That which does not kill me makes me stronger.’
L662644 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
L662643 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ The doctor who saved him couldn’t get it out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation. Effectively, he’s a dead man.
L662642 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ He survived?
L662640 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ How many deaths is he responsible for? How many innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same circumstances, I’d do the same again.
L662639 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
L662638 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektra’s ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me.  I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.
L662637 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Renard.
L662636 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
L662635 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Who?
L662634 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ It’s a message.  He wants us to know he’s back.
L662632 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra.
L662631 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ I’m well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
L662630 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I was the one who brought that money in...
L662629 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ You haven’t been given an assignment in this case.
L662628 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I took the initiative.
L662627 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Who told you to look at Elektra’s files?
L662613 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ And now it’s up for grabs, a goldrush. Far more oil than anyone thought.
L662612 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Caviar capital of the world. Matchless beluga. Firm, yet subtle.  Largest landlocked body of water on Earth.  Oil-rich.  Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it.
L662611 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ 007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?
L662593 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose.
L662592 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ It’s barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
L662591 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ I’ve scheduled a medical for you.
L662590 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ She’s not a girl anymore.
L662589 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Elektra?  Running King Industries?  I’ve known that girl all her life. I’m not sure she knows what she’s walking into.
L662566 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Who buys classified reports for three million pounds.
L662565 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. He’s a man of great integrity.
L662564 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Old friend?
L662563 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Quite the opposite, in fact.
L662562 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Construction’s not exactly my line.
L662549 +++$+++ u8969 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ LACHAISE +++$+++ I can’t tell you...  Alright, alright! But you must protect me!
L662548 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ The name?
L662546 +++$+++ u8969 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ LACHAISE +++$+++ Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me?
L662545 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Your last chance. Give me the name.
L662544 +++$+++ u8969 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ LACHAISE +++$+++ Your last chance. Take the money.
L662543 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.
L662542 +++$+++ u8969 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ LACHAISE +++$+++ I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...
L662541 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Who did you get it from?
L662540 +++$+++ u8969 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ LACHAISE +++$+++ I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.
L662532 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Which is neutral, no doubt.
L662531 +++$+++ u8969 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ LACHAISE +++$+++ Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position..
L663163 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Haven’t you heard the news?  So is she.
L663162 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ In case you’ve forgotten.  I’m dead already.
L662859 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ You even brought the plane for us.  We really couldn’t have done it without you.
L662858 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ She’ll get over it.
L662857 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ It’s I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6.  So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair.
L662856 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Consider me ungrateful.
L662855 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
L662854 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
L662853 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?  She’s beautiful isn’t she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...
L662852 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Who is it?
L662851 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
L662850 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Revenge isn’t so hard to fathom. What’s clever is getting someone else to pay for it.
L662844 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Indeed.
L662843 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty.
L662586 +++$+++ u8973 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ He died before he could complete his lifelong dream.  I intend to finish it for him.
L662585 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I’m sorry.
L662584 +++$+++ u8973 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ He was my father.
L662583 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ You knew him well?
L662582 +++$+++ u8973 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ A word? I’m sure by now he’s engineered a hostile takeover.
L662581 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
L662580 +++$+++ u8973 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
L662579 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Yes.
L662578 +++$+++ u8973 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Beautiful, isn’t it?
L663134 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Oh James.
L663133 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ One... last... screw?
L663130 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Elektra, it’s not too late.  Eight million people needn’t die.
L663129 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Know what happens when a man is strangled?
L663126 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.
L663125 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ It runs in my veins, thicker than blood. I’m going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfather’s name, the glory of my people.
L663124 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ It is my oil!  Mine and my family’s!
L663123 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Was this all about the oil?
L663122 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
L663121 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ So you killed your father.
L663119 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Just like you...only you were even easier.
L663118 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ You turned Renard.
L663117 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Since I was a child, I’ve always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldn’t rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.
L663116 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Five more turns and your neck will break.
L663115 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ All this, because you fell for Renard?
L663114 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Soon she’ll be everywhere.
L663113 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Where’s M?
L663111 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Not interested.
L663110 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ I could have given you the world.
L662912 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ You do what you have to do, but I’ve called in M.  She’s en route from London even now.
L662911 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I’m coming with you.
L662909 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ You knew.  You knew all the time, that he was out there, that he was coming for me, and you lied. You used me, you used me as bait. You made love to me -- what, to pass the time as you waited for him to strike?
L662908 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ He used your exact words.
L662907 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didn’t have to sleep with you to find that out.
L662905 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I think you do.
L662904 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ I don’t know what you’re talking about!
L662903 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ You can drop the act, it’s over.
L662902 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Are you saying...Renard is the man who’s trying to kill me?
L662901 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
L662900 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ ...what?
L662899 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
L662898 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L662897 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ A little. Does it matter? After all, what’s the point of living if you can’t feel alive?  Isn’t that right, Elektra? Isn’t that your motto?
L662896 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ What’s wrong with you?  Are you crazy?
L662816 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ I used my body on the guards.  It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance.  I’ve never told anyone that.
L662815 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ How did you survive?
L662809 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Shush.
L662808 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ You knew when you first saw me.  You knew it would be like this.
L662799 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Not at that price. Time to surrender.
L662798 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Surely you believe in living dangerously.
L662783 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Really?
L662782 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I understand it’s normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end.
L662777 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ You had your chance, James. Now I’m looking for a bigger thrill.
L662776 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ If this little show is for my benefit, I’ll take you home right now.
L662775 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Someone wants to kill me, I’d rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?
L662774 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ What the hell are you doing here?
L662773 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Two. Shaken not stirred.
L662772 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Vodka martini.
L662744 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I have to go to work.
L662743 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ I don’t want to be safe!
L662742 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ No. You’ll be safe here.
L662741 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Then take me with you.
L662740 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I have to go.
L662739 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ James...
L662738 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ ...you should rest.
L662737 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ What is it?
L662736 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I think you’re one of the bravest people I’ve ever met.
L662735 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ The way I acted, in the snow...you must think I’m a coward.
L662729 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ I know.
L662728 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I can’t stay.
L662723 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ It’s the only way out...
L662722 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ No!  It will cave in!
L662721 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ You’re not going to.
L662720 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ I can’t stay here.
L662719 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ We’re alright.
L662718 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Oh my God...we’re buried alive...
L662708 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ No.
L662707 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ You don’t take no for an answer, do you?
L662706 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Always wanted to see the upper lines.
L662705 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ I have to check the upper lines.  Gabor will drive you back.
L662698 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
L662697 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially King’s daughter.
L662696 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ That’s every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  That’s why you’re here, isn’t it? You think I can’t do it. You think I’m going to screw up. Or get myself killed.
L662695 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ The killer doesn’t want to see this pipeline continue, doesn’t want to see you take over...
L662694 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ If you’ve come here to look after me, Mr. Bond, thank you, but no thank you.  I have two bodyguards, I don’t need a third...
L662693 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ It’s not the pin your father wore. It’s an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
L662692 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
L662691 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ It’s my father’s pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
L662690 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Does this look familiar to you?
L662689 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?
L662688 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ How long has he been with you?
L662687 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. He’s decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an excellent omelette.
L662686 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Who is he?
L662683 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Partially, yes.
L662682 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
L662681 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I don’t want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  I’m not sure he knew that.
L662680 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Funerals aren’t exactly memorable.
L662679 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ I haven’t been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
L662678 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Yes.
L662677 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ I met you at my father’s funeral.
L663101 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ I’d heard there were some renovations there...no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years.
L663100 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ How appropriate.
L663099 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ The Maiden’s Tower.
L663069 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.
L663068 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ Mother of God.
L663043 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ Istanbul.
L663042 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Where?
L663041 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ So.  My way.  No MI-6, no Interpol.  Just you, me and my people.
L663036 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!
L663035 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
L663034 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ No!  Get me out!
L663033 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Where’s the sub going?!
L663030 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ A special job.  A...a...a submarine.
L663029 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ And the payoff on the tables?
L663028 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ Alright, alright!  Sometimes I smuggle machinery for her.  Russian stuff.
L663024 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ No.  The truth!  She thought I was dead -- those blades were meant for you.  What do you know that she would kill you for?
L663023 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ A rope!
L663022 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Now...where were we?
L663018 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ You are out of your league.  She’s working with Renard.
L663017 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined!
L663016 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks.
L663015 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didn’t even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
L663014 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ I thought you were the one in her business.
L663013 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ What’s your business with Elektra King?
L663012 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ Really Bond, couldn’t you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?
L663011 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ Ah, I see.  A purely...plutonic relationship.
L663010 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ She’s no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
L663009 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
L662766 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline.
L662765 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.
L662764 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ How high up does this...arms dealing go?
L662763 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ That too. Everyone does what they can to survive.
L662761 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me.
L662760 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ Where did you get this?
L662759 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.
L662758 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ What?  This is not possible.
L662757 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?
L662756 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ See?  You’re upsetting my customers. What do you want?
L662751 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ Have some of the rat’s nest caviar.  From my own fishery.  They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my House.
L662750 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  A nice little rat’s nest.
L662749 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ Bond, I’m a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal family’s, now it’s mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
L662748 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ You, of course. I need some information.
L662747 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
L662746 +++$+++ u8965 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Valentin Zukovsky.
L663064 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ C-class.
L663063 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ What class sub does your nephew run?
L663062 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.
L663059 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.
L663058 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ What is this place?
L663038 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ Bond!
L663037 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ No! Bond!
L663032 +++$+++ u8974 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ZUKOVSKY +++$+++ To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.
L663031 +++$+++ u8966 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ CHRISTMAS +++$+++ What?
L663087 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead.
L663086 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Someone will come.
L663085 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Now you know how it feels.  To be locked away, to wonder if they’re coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.
L663001 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Is nothing.  His kingdom he stole from my mother. The kingdom I will rightly take back.
L663000 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Your father...
L662999 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didn’t think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.
L662965 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Please.
L662964 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Perhaps this isn’t the time...
L662890 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Could...could you come?
L662889 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ I’ll send someone out.
L663141 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ Yes.  Au revoir...
L663140 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Everything’s under control up here.  Are you ready?
L663093 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ No.  It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.
L663092 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ This is the end.
L663049 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ What do you think?
L663048 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ He was a...good lover?
L663047 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Of course...
L663046 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ Why are you like this?  Because Bond is dead?  It’s what you wanted.
L663045 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ How would you know?
L663044 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.
L662994 +++$+++ u8971 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ RENARD +++$+++ Is it?
L662993 +++$+++ u8968 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ ELEKTRA +++$+++ Warm.
L663194 +++$+++ u8972 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ Still no contact yet.
L663193 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Any word from him?
L662931 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Where it can do the most damage.
L662930 +++$+++ u8972 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ It’s heading for the oil terminal.
L662929 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ The parcel’s in the post.
L662883 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Marvellous.
L662882 +++$+++ u8972 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
L662881 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Do we have the range of Renard’s plane?
L662609 +++$+++ u8972 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ And expensive.  Cost three million plus.
L662608 +++$+++ u8970 +++$+++ m611 +++$+++ M +++$+++ We’ve been pawns in someone’s game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate.  Cock-sure.
L663447 +++$+++ u8975 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ ADAMSON +++$+++ Please.
L663446 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ What?!
L663445 +++$+++ u8975 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ ADAMSON +++$+++ The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.
L663444 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I would like to use the bathroom --
L663443 +++$+++ u8975 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ ADAMSON +++$+++ I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
L663442 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Why?  What's the problem?
L663441 +++$+++ u8975 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ ADAMSON +++$+++ Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
L663440 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
L663643 +++$+++ u8987 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.
L663642 +++$+++ u8976 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ ANALYST +++$+++ We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
L663641 +++$+++ u8987 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
L663640 +++$+++ u8976 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ ANALYST +++$+++ As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
L663638 +++$+++ u8976 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ ANALYST +++$+++ Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.
L663637 +++$+++ u8987 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ What kind of time frame are we talking about?
L663636 +++$+++ u8976 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ ANALYST +++$+++ Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.
L663635 +++$+++ u8987 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ What about our end?
L663303 +++$+++ u8977 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ They want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.
L663302 +++$+++ u8981 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ HYDE +++$+++ Washington?
L663301 +++$+++ u8977 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
L663300 +++$+++ u8981 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ HYDE +++$+++ Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
L663299 +++$+++ u8977 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ No idea who's behind this?
L663298 +++$+++ u8981 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ HYDE +++$+++ You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
L663297 +++$+++ u8977 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Had a lot of blood in him.
L663846 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?
L663845 +++$+++ u8978 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. LONG +++$+++ That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --
L663829 +++$+++ u8978 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. LONG +++$+++ We don't know that.
L663828 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ God isn't there to do it.
L663827 +++$+++ u8978 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. LONG +++$+++ Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?
L663826 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Why, doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.
L663825 +++$+++ u8978 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. LONG +++$+++ And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
L663824 +++$+++ u8978 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. LONG +++$+++ Who is she?  Do you know her?
L663823 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ A whore fucking.
L663779 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
L663778 +++$+++ u8978 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. LONG +++$+++ There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
L663777 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Wrong answers?
L663776 +++$+++ u8978 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. LONG +++$+++ Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
L663775 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Don't call me that.
L663774 +++$+++ u8978 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. LONG +++$+++ Walter --
L664176 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
L664175 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
L663366 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
L663365 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
L663363 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.
L663362 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ What's your theory?
L663361 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
L663360 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is "stalking" the Watchmen.
L663357 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
L663356 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ The bearer of bad news.
L663352 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Hello, Adrian.
L663351 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Hi, Jon.
L664185 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!
L664184 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Jon -- for God¹s sake, what do you see?
L664183 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
L664182 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Jon --
L664169 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Veidt¹s complex.
L664168 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Jon, where are we?
L664155 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ The south pole.  Time¹s flowing backwards.
L664154 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Jon -- what??
L664153 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ It¹s very strange.  Time¹s flowing backwards . . .
L664141 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Cured, yes.
L664140 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ What -- am I --
L664139 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Jon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you -- then do it.
L664138 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
L664137 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
L664136 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ I won't do that.
L664135 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
L664134 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ You're the only human being I care for.
L664133 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
L664132 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
L664131 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Jon, I do not want to hear it.
L664082 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see.
L664081 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.
L664080 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ I don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.
L664079 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
L664078 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Because --
L664077 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
L664076 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Always.  Ever since the day I died.
L664075 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
L664074 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.
L664073 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ But you knew that I'd -- die.
L664072 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
L664071 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
L664070 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
L664069 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?
L664067 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.
L664066 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
L664065 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
L664064 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.
L664062 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ You -- you know about me and Dan?
L664061 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
L664060 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?
L664047 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
L664046 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.
L664041 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ It will happen, Laurie.  I've already seen it.  Neither of us can do anything to change it.
L664040 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Jon, no -- I can't --
L664039 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
L664038 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Collect me?
L664037 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.
L663397 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ . . . And just how would you manage that?
L663396 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ I could stay and go.
L663395 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Mm hmm.
L663394 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Would you like me to stay?
L663392 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Not yet, there's plenty of time.
L663391 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
L663390 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ I'm here, Laurie.
L663359 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
L663358 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Blake?  Dead?
L664172 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ We'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.
L664171 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
L664170 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.
L664165 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Then I¹ve been a very bad boy and you¹ll have to spank me.  Christ!  I¹m doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!
L664164 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ What if you¹re wrong??
L664163 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ I¹m not.
L664162 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ And what if you¹re wrong?
L664161 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Don¹t be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We won¹t even be here, will we?
L664150 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ I've seen them!  I've seen them in there. 
L664149 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Adrian -- you've lost it.
L664148 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
L664147 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ What is it?  How does it work?
L664146 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.  Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.
L664128 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ It's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.
L664127 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?
L664126 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr. Manhattan.
L664117 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
L664116 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ What??
L664111 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Uh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked at Gila Flats.
L664110 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ The missing scientists.
L664109 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .
L663803 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know.
L663802 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
L663801 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ She's with me.
L663800 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
L663799 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Who?
L663343 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Good night.
L663342 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
L663341 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ No.  I just wanted you to --
L663340 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
L663339 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
L663338 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
L663337 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.
L663336 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Us.  You mean the Watchmen.
L663335 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
L663334 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
L663333 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.
L664215 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ We'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't they -- ?
L664214 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
L664213 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Dan -- what do we do now?
L664201 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Everything's changed --
L664200 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Those cars.  What year is this??
L664199 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Dan, is this -- is this New York??
L664196 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Where did he go?
L664195 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ He saved himself.  He changed the past.
L664179 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --
L664178 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ What was he doing?
L664018 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
L664017 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Welcome back, Night Owl.
L664001 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
L664000 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
L663985 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ My God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and he stops to take a --
L663984 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ I think he's going to the john.
L663983 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ What's he doing?
L663949 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ . . . What??
L663948 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
L663947 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
L663946 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's about to end.  I feel like I could save it.
L663945 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ That's because --
L663944 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
L663943 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Yes you are.
L663942 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.
L663941 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ The costumes.  Am I right?
L663940 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ What?
L663923 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
L663922 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ They're practically on us . . .
L663921 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
L663920 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
L663915 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ All right.  Mission accomplished.
L663914 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ They're following us.
L663891 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Oh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No.
L663890 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
L663889 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ What the hell -- ?
L663869 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Okay!
L663868 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ This'd better not be what I think it is.
L663867 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Don't look.  Turn around.
L663866 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ What are you up to?
L663865 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
L663864 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.  The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't know.  It all seems so abstract.
L663863 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.
L663861 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ You and me.
L663860 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
L663859 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
L663858 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Antarctica??
L663857 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.
L663854 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ -- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
L663853 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ The Owlship.  I can't believe it.
L663849 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Memory lane.
L663848 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?
L663810 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.
L663809 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
L663808 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Laurie --
L663807 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
L663806 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ -- What is it.
L663805 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
L663804 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?
L663758 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.
L663757 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?
L663754 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.
L663753 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.
L663725 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
L663724 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ . . . What?
L663723 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
L663722 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Old?
L663721 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
L663720 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
L663719 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
L663718 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
L663706 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Play one.  Educate yourself.
L663705 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
L663704 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.
L663697 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?
L663696 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ His . . . whatever.
L663695 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ His what?
L663663 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?
L663662 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
L663658 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ You're sure?
L663657 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.
L663656 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --
L663654 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Dan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I've spent all these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel -- I feel glad.  I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own life, and --
L663653 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Maybe not, but why take chances?
L663652 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
L663651 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ You'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each other, someone might put two and two together . . .
L663650 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
L663649 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?
L663432 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
L663431 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
L663430 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
L663429 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
L663428 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
L663427 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
L663426 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Damn straight!  We were heroes.
L663425 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Damn straight.
L663421 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ 
L663420 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices.
L663419 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty tricks -- political assassinations --
L663418 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
L663417 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
L663416 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
L663415 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
L664160 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Adrian.  It¹s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.
L664159 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ . . . And they call me a fucking nut.
L664108 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Adrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and --
L664107 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
L664106 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
L664088 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
L664087 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ What caused it?
L664086 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
L664085 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ What happened?
L664057 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
L664056 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.
L664055 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ SHUT UP, Rorschach.
L664054 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Coward.  Giving up.
L664053 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
L664052 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --
L664051 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're hightailing it down to Adrian's.
L664044 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ I don't think she's coming with us.
L664043 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Where's Laurie?
L664024 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --
L664023 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
L664022 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?
L664021 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
L664020 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ What do you mean, frame-up?
L664019 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
L663999 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . . 
L663998 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ What new information?
L663997 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
L663996 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
L663987 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.
L663986 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ . . . That was quick.
L663327 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?
L663326 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Maybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with a grudge.  Thought you might want to spread the word.
L663325 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
L663324 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ So do I.  So do you.
L663322 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Human bean juice.  The Comedian is dead.
L663321 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
L663319 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?
L663318 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.
L663545 +++$+++ u8983 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JON +++$+++ My dad's a watchmaker.  I'll put it back together for you.  Better than ever.
L663544 +++$+++ u8982 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ -- What?
L663543 +++$+++ u8983 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JON +++$+++ I can fix it.
L663539 +++$+++ u8983 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JON +++$+++ Janey, will you marry me?
L663538 +++$+++ u8982 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --
L663536 +++$+++ u8982 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ We should get back to the lab.  You okay, Jon?
L663535 +++$+++ u8983 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JON +++$+++ Nothing.  What were you going to say?
L663534 +++$+++ u8982 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ We should get back --  What?
L663533 +++$+++ u8983 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JON +++$+++ Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
L663532 +++$+++ u8982 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
L663531 +++$+++ u8983 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JON +++$+++ Nothing wrong with ketchup.
L663530 +++$+++ u8982 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ With lots of ketchup?
L663529 +++$+++ u8983 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JON +++$+++ I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.
L663787 +++$+++ u8984 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ Isn't it true that you --
L663786 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ I did not.  Now get out of my way!
L663785 +++$+++ u8984 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ Did you know he was back on the streets?
L663784 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ No comment.
L663682 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ No.  We laid out very careful ground rules --
L663681 +++$+++ u8984 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
L663680 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.
L663679 +++$+++ u8984 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
L663678 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Sphinx brand.  When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco, that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it?  In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?
L663599 +++$+++ u8989 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ SCHMIDT +++$+++ That's right.  Your meal ticket's flown the coop.  That blue bastard has apparently left the planet.
L663598 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Jon??  You mean he's --
L663597 +++$+++ u8989 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ SCHMIDT +++$+++ Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
L663596 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
L663595 +++$+++ u8989 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ SCHMIDT +++$+++ You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
L663594 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Am I free to go?
L663593 +++$+++ u8989 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ SCHMIDT +++$+++ All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
L663468 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
L663467 +++$+++ u8989 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ SCHMIDT +++$+++ Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
L663466 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ What does this mean?  What does it --
L663465 +++$+++ u8989 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ SCHMIDT +++$+++ I'm terribly sorry.
L663464 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
L663463 +++$+++ u8989 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ SCHMIDT +++$+++ Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
L663462 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Then why don't you ask him?!?
L663461 +++$+++ u8989 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ SCHMIDT +++$+++ You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
L663460 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I don't know their real names!
L663459 +++$+++ u8989 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ SCHMIDT +++$+++ You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
L663458 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I don't know their real names.
L663457 +++$+++ u8989 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ SCHMIDT +++$+++ Their real names, please.
L663379 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ I'm sorry about Blake.
L663378 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Maybe I'll do that.
L663377 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.  Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.
L663376 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.
L663375 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ What about you?
L663374 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
L663373 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
L663372 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
L663371 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ He's a little farther gone every time.
L663370 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Please.
L663369 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
L663368 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
L663350 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.
L663349 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
L663348 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Don't rub it in.  I live here.
L663347 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Laurie!  Good to see you.
L663346 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Adrian.
L663671 +++$+++ u8986 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ MOLOCH +++$+++ No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got something for you.
L663670 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.
L663629 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.
L663628 +++$+++ u8986 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ MOLOCH +++$+++ CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
L663627 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
L663626 +++$+++ u8986 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ MOLOCH +++$+++ Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --
L663622 +++$+++ u8986 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ MOLOCH +++$+++ ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?
L663621 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.
L663620 +++$+++ u8986 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ MOLOCH +++$+++ You're making a big --
L663619 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.
L663618 +++$+++ u8986 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ MOLOCH +++$+++ I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong guy.
L664123 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
L664122 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
L664119 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ No.  I just hastened the inevitable.  He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
L664118 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.
L664113 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
L664112 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
L663691 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Fate of the world at stake, Adrian.  Can't get too worked up over bad press.
L663690 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.
L663689 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .
L663688 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ What is that ungodly smell?
L663687 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
L663686 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Ever see one of these before?
L663685 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ New information.
L665331 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You're a jerk-off, you know that?
L665330 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
L665329 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ No needles, huh? What about the acid bath?
L665328 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?
L665327 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
L665326 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside.
L665325 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Who says you're the good guys?
L665324 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.
L665323 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ But I hate cops, remember? Except for her.
L665322 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.
L665321 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
L665320 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
L665247 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ We don't have that kinda time, boss, I don't think Prague's gonna be around much longer. I've gotta go now. I've got a lot of bad guys to kill.
L665246 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. You've done your job, X, head back to Prague. I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now.
L665245 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.
L665244 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
L665243 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
L665242 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity.
L665241 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then that.
L665240 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Yes it does.
L665239 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that "classified" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song "Silent Night" mean anything to you?
L665238 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
L665237 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Snow covered fortress. Army of bad guys. The usual.
L665162 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You ain't seen nothing yet.
L665161 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
L665160 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Thanks.
L665159 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ I'm gonna be en route with a team shortly to relieve you. Just keep the pressure on until the cavalry arrives. And X? You done yourself proud helping those people today.
L665158 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?
L665157 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab".
L665156 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac.
L665155 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ You did say "Ahab"? You're sure about that?
L664955 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I know, poison needles in my shins. You've got 36 hours. Peace, out.
L664954 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...
L664953 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?
L664952 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.
L664951 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
L664950 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ We're not after car thieves here.
L664949 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?
L664948 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
L664947 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
L664946 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.
L664945 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a purchase. Ten cars.
L664869 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Just remember, I'll be watching.
L664868 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Is that all?
L664867 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Crude and defiant as always, Triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene.
L664866 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Up yours.
L664863 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.
L664862 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.
L664859 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Yeah, I spy or I die.
L664858 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear?
L664857 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ How about a pedicure as long as you're down there. What's this? Lo-Jack?
L664849 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ What's with that "X" on the back of your head? Does that mean you're "extreme"? I've got some news for you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser. So maybe you should tattoo another couple of X's on your head.
L664848 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Not bad for a gimp.
L664847 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You're one sick bastard. A sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission. I think no matter which way I go I'm likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic. So here's my answer: kiss my ass, Hop-along.
L664846 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
L664845 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What do I get out of it?
L664844 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
L664843 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?
L664839 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ That's too bad. I thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge.
L664838 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
L664837 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger.
L664836 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I'm not interested. I've already got a job.
L664835 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help.
L664834 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.
L664833 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution.
L664832 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Good thing you were there to save the day. Come walk with me.
L664831 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
L664830 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.
L664772 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ You know what I hate? It's always the assholes that pass the tests.
L664771 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
L664770 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.
L664769 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Is that a fact?
L664768 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.
L664767 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
L664766 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
L664765 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
L664764 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Why is that?
L664763 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ ..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
L664762 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
L664761 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
L664760 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
L664759 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
L664758 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
L664757 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
L664756 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.
L664753 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Diner, huh? Let me tell you what the problem is. I wake up drugged to find what? You've got a "salesman" over here reading a three week old newspaper. He's pulling a 211 with a "trucker", who happens to be packing a cop issue H&K 9mm. I get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note. How's that for twisted logic? How did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before I "walked" in? And if that's true, why'd they stop and wait until I woke up to gaffle the money? Then I notice how beefy they both are. Hell, even the waitress is cut. All three of them look like they went through the same training program. Ergo they ain't strangers and this isn't what it seems. That's how I knew yo-yo wouldn't get a round off even if I gave him all day. Why?
L664752 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Looks like a diner.
L664751 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What is this place?
L664750 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
L664749 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Who the hell are you?
L664964 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I can deal with that.
L664963 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad.
L664962 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ Why not? You were going to throw him in a tub full of acid, weren't you?
L664961 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play.  I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen.
L664960 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
L664959 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
L664958 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ You what? A wire transfer of this size?
L664957 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ I think we should send him whatever he wants.
L664956 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time.
L664695 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ That's exactly why we need them.
L664694 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ They're degenerates. There's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over.
L664693 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ I've seen enough. Turn it off.
L664692 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ But programmable. And expendable.
L664691 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ The scum of the Earth.
L664690 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ The usual prospects. Convicts, contract killers, murde...
L664689 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. I've had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your desktop.
L664688 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
L664687 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
L664686 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ How will you fix it?
L664685 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
L664684 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
L664683 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands.
L664682 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost.
L664681 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Not a whole helluva lot. His final transmission was mangled. About something or someone called "Ahab". Whatever it is, it cost him his life.
L664680 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ What do you have?
L664809 +++$+++ u8992 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ JEFE +++$+++ Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?
L664808 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.
L664807 +++$+++ u8992 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ JEFE +++$+++ You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.
L664806 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ We're on to the game, ese. You got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... It's all very cute. But come on, let's quit while you're ahead. I'm only trying to save you a beatin'.
L664800 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ We're anti-social. We don't have any friends.
L664799 +++$+++ u8992 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ JEFE +++$+++ We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?
L664798 +++$+++ u8992 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ JEFE +++$+++ That's some accident, hombre. You accidentally fall out of a plane in the middle of the night and land up in my back yard.
L664797 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
L664796 +++$+++ u8992 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ JEFE +++$+++ Whatchu doing here?
L664891 +++$+++ u8993 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ KID +++$+++ He gets to be the hero.
L664890 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Like what?
L664889 +++$+++ u8993 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ KID +++$+++ Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
L664888 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
L664887 +++$+++ u8993 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ KID +++$+++ What do you get if you finish?
L664886 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Just about anything I want, it looks like. This is gonna be tough, though. There's no way to save this game. I gotta get it right the first time through.
L664885 +++$+++ u8993 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ KID +++$+++ What weapons do you have?
L664884 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
L664883 +++$+++ u8993 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ KID +++$+++ "Anarchy" 99"?
L664882 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called it "blood week". He combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99.
L664879 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Kirill, the sniper. Looks like a bookworm, but he had 72 confirmed kills in Chechnya, they called him the "Finger of God". Assassination and weapons.
L664878 +++$+++ u8993 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ KID +++$+++ This guy's kinda dorky lookin'.
L664877 +++$+++ u8993 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ KID +++$+++ Naturally.
L664876 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Next we got a Siberian redneck, Viktor. Into snowmobiles and snowboarding. So naturally, he covers prostitution and the drug trade.
L664874 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You wanna check it out? Come here.
L664873 +++$+++ u8993 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ KID +++$+++ Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
L664872 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.
L664871 +++$+++ u8993 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ KID +++$+++ What game is that?
L665336 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.
L665335 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ What are you doing?
L665334 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You can't welch on me now. We had a deal.
L665333 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I can't believe my mission is finally over. I don't even know what to do with myself.
L665314 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!
L665313 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
L665312 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
L665311 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.
L665309 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better.
L665308 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
L665307 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You can't talk to it?
L665306 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ He's shut out the communication circuit!
L665303 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop playing nice.
L665302 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ A piece of shrapnel hit me.
L665301 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You okay?
L665298 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Let me.
L665297 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Toadies right behind.
L665296 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Go to the water, it's that way!
L665295 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Where'd the damn truck go?!
L665289 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.
L665288 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Where's he headed?
L665287 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Let's do this.
L665286 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.
L665285 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Did you do your homework?
L665282 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them.
L665281 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Yorgi and Kirill.
L665270 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ He's a regular humanitarian. And all this time I thought he was just a tool.
L665269 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Don't you see, X? For the betterment of humanity, he's going to start World War Three.
L665230 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ What the hell are we doing? We're doing all this together, trusting each other, making plans, and we haven't even slept together yet.
L665229 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
L665228 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
L665227 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
L665226 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
L665225 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You don't have to do that.
L665224 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
L665223 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
L665222 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Aren't you afraid?
L665221 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ We'll have to go after them.
L665220 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ They left. To a fortress in the mountains.
L665218 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Why? You're the one who believes in nothing. Screw the world, or whatever you said.
L665217 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ We can't leave now. We have to do something.
L665216 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander?
L665215 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.
L665214 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
L665213 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
L665212 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
L665211 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?
L665210 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.
L665209 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Where are we going?
L665208 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now.
L665207 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What are you doing with the Ivans?
L665206 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.
L665205 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
L665204 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
L665203 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Are you alright?
L665179 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ You can't, it's too risky. I'm not much help anyway, remember?
L665178 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ When can I see you again?
L665177 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
L665176 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
L665175 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ No, I guess I've been no help at all to you.
L665174 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I'm busted up for you, but Jesus, what the hell are you doing? Those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn't lift a finger.
L665173 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
L665172 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
L665171 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
L665170 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What's that?
L665169 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
L665168 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
L665167 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
L665166 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?
L665132 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ They'll kill you, you know they will. Besides, there is no back door. Keep smiling. Ready? Now.
L665131 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I can't let this happen. I want you to go out the back. I'll make up some excuse.
L665129 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Not an option. Just get up slowly like everything's cool. Petra, trust me. You just hung yourself out to dry for me, I'm not gonna let you down.
L665128 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ That's alright, I'll figure something out.
L665127 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.
L665126 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.
L665125 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.
L665124 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.
L665123 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L665122 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ They tell me you're an American agent.
L665116 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out?
L665115 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ A beach named X? That I'd like to see.
L665114 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.
L665113 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
L665112 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.
L665111 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it?
L665110 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.
L665109 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
L665108 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
L665107 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.
L665106 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
L665105 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
L665104 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I'm from L.A.
L665103 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.
L665098 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?
L665097 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ What are you?
L665095 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Look at you. You're helping run things now. You're a gangster. I bet that snuck up on you. You woke up one day and you were a criminal.
L665094 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Go to hell!
L665093 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.
L665092 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about.
L665084 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ That makes two of us then, sweetheart, because I ain't buying your bullshit either. You're not like them, I can see it in your eyes. So you tell me, who's bullshitting who?
L665083 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are.
L665082 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Hey, you're good.
L665081 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid.
L665080 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets.
L665079 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude trying to make a buck.
L665078 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?
L665077 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ We hung out last night, remember?
L665076 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Who are you?
L665049 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ That right? Why's that?
L665048 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type.
L665047 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Come on, don't front like that. You'll put a guy right off you.
L665046 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.
L665045 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I was invited. What's your story?
L665044 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
L665043 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Where are you going?
L665042 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Did you guys used to date? That's it, right? He broke your heart and you're still soft on him. That's funny, it don't seem to fit with a tough broad like you.
L665041 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Mind your business.
L665040 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?
L665039 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Go to hell.
L665038 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You do everything Yorgi says?
L665037 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Yorgi asked me to.
L665036 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?
L664938 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ So cute. He shows up for a battle of wits with a mental butter knife.
L664937 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.
L664936 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.
L664935 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.
L664934 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Do you know what a wire transfer is?
L664933 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I have Japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet, if you have the quality of merchandise they're after. And it's a mil two, max.
L664932 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're talking a lousy million five U.S.
L665260 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Nice place to start, don't you think?
L665259 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ The Peace conference...
L665148 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Viktor! Stay the course.
L665147 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
L665146 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
L665145 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
L665144 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ What was that for?
L665139 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate accident.
L665138 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ What are you doing?
L664998 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Perhaps he is not all he says he is.
L664997 +++$+++ u8994 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ PETRA +++$+++ Nothing. He had two days.
L664994 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I thought that was in detail.
L664993 +++$+++ u8996 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SHAVERS +++$+++ Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.
L664992 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You're joking, right?
L664991 +++$+++ u8996 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SHAVERS +++$+++ It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
L664990 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ From the Beastie Boys collection?
L664989 +++$+++ u8996 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SHAVERS +++$+++ Think again, that's government property. You have to sign for everything. I've got one more that wasn't on your list.
L664988 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I think I'll hang on to these.
L664984 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ That one I'm real familiar with.
L664983 +++$+++ u8996 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SHAVERS +++$+++ This is your standard dart gun.
L664982 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ They come in any other styles or colors?
L664981 +++$+++ u8996 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SHAVERS +++$+++ Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface.
L664975 +++$+++ u8996 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SHAVERS +++$+++ Listen to you. Right away, sir, anything you say, sir.
L664974 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
L664973 +++$+++ u8996 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SHAVERS +++$+++ Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
L664972 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I stole your beat, huh? Guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people.
L664971 +++$+++ u8996 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SHAVERS +++$+++ Back off, just go away you klutz. Alright, here's the story. The items in these cases belong to me. I designed them, built them, and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up.
L664967 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ That's would be me.
L664966 +++$+++ u8996 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SHAVERS +++$+++ Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s.
L664722 +++$+++ u8997 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SKY +++$+++ You're wrong about that. I'm heading out that door right now.
L664721 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
L664720 +++$+++ u8997 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SKY +++$+++ You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
L664719 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
L664718 +++$+++ u8997 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SKY +++$+++ This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
L664717 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
L664716 +++$+++ u8997 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SKY +++$+++ You're serious?
L664715 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
L664714 +++$+++ u8997 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SKY +++$+++ What...?
L664713 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now.
L664712 +++$+++ u8997 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SKY +++$+++ It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
L664711 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Alright, so I'll get more.
L664710 +++$+++ u8997 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SKY +++$+++ French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?
L664708 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I don't wanna go mersh, you know that. But hey, if this is about money...
L664707 +++$+++ u8997 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SKY +++$+++ You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.
L664706 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I'm having fun, what's the problem?
L664705 +++$+++ u8997 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SKY +++$+++ You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
L664704 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I can see that. Why?
L664703 +++$+++ u8997 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SKY +++$+++ I'm through, Xander.
L664702 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation...
L665201 +++$+++ u8998 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SLOVO +++$+++ They came and found me. They said they'd kill me unless I help them. Plus they offer me a lot of money. No big deal. These things happen. Dump your gun on the floor.
L665200 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Why you dogging me up?
L665199 +++$+++ u8998 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SLOVO +++$+++ Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
L665198 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What's the deal?
L665197 +++$+++ u8998 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SLOVO +++$+++ Sorry, "dude".
L665195 +++$+++ u8998 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SLOVO +++$+++ Is this what you're looking for?
L665194 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.
L665193 +++$+++ u8998 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SLOVO +++$+++ You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?
L665192 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Dude, what are you doing here?
L664970 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Yeah, thanks a lot.
L664969 +++$+++ u8998 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SLOVO +++$+++ I'll leave you two alone to talk.
L664903 +++$+++ u8998 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SLOVO +++$+++ The corner. Anarchy 99.
L664902 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Nice hops.
L664900 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ First of all, you should kill whoever sold you that suit. Two, I don't wanna be here either, so just step off. Three, if you had the authority to shoot me you would've done it by now, so just ease up on the machismo, bitch. Now that we've got that sorted out, I'm gonna get some rest.
L664899 +++$+++ u8998 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SLOVO +++$+++ You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our.
L664898 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Here we go again.
L664897 +++$+++ u8998 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SLOVO +++$+++ My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you.
L664896 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I've been on a plane for twelve hours, I think I'll stand.
L664895 +++$+++ u8998 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SLOVO +++$+++ Sit down.
L664824 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.
L664823 +++$+++ u8999 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ VIRG +++$+++ They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?
L664818 +++$+++ u8999 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ VIRG +++$+++ It's like you said, every man for himself.
L664817 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Help me with this guy.
L664803 +++$+++ u8999 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ VIRG +++$+++ He's a pretty good actor, though.
L664802 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
L664780 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ A parachute. This does not argue well.
L664779 +++$+++ u8999 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ VIRG +++$+++ Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
L664775 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Been to any good diners lately?
L664774 +++$+++ u8999 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ VIRG +++$+++ What's so damn funny?
L665272 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked.
L665271 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of --
L665268 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Come on, Xander. You used to stand for something. What happened to you, man? I thought you'd get it.
L665267 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ And here I thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt.
L665266 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.
L665265 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Including rape, pillage, murder.
L665264 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.
L665263 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ So all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world.
L665262 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
L665261 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's the part I don't get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche.
L665258 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is.
L665257 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
L665256 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
L665250 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.
L665249 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ That was for Anders.
L665067 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ You want to insult me? This is my hospitality. Pick one.
L665066 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ That's alright, I'm kinda tired.
L665065 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ I've got meetings this afternoon, I've got to get some sleep. Just pick a girl.
L665059 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ My old man, he bought into the system, and it screwed him. So he swallowed a bullet. Me, I don't believe in nothing I can't see and touch.
L665058 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.
L665057 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.
L665056 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
L665055 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg.
L665054 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.
L665053 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live.
L665033 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Easy. You get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss.
L665032 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
L665031 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.
L665030 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ "...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.
L665029 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: "America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free..."
L665028 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ That's what I'm talking about, man! That's why Anarchy 99 was born.
L665027 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Screw the world. If I'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money.
L665026 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You wanna see my politics?
L665025 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
L665024 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What's "Anarchy 99"?
L665023 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 99!
L665020 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Had to do what I had to do.
L665019 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ I don't believe it! You can't shoot a cop in the middle of the street!
L665014 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.
L665013 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
L665012 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
L665011 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ What's going on, my friend?
L665004 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ This is a gift. From me to you.
L665003 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What's this?
L665002 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Of course.
L665001 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I had to inspect the merchandise first.
L665000 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ I'm somewhat less so. We seem to have a bit of a problem...
L664999 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Very nice. I'm impressed.
L664940 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ It'll work faster if I have an account number.
L664939 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.
L664930 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.
L664929 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?
L664926 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ When else are you gonna do it?
L664925 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ I remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour.
L664919 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here. If you don't know about 'em, who does?
L664918 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
L664917 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Thanks, but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars, expensive ones. A lot of them.
L664916 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ I appreciate you bringing this to our attention. Whatever you want, the rest of the night, consider it on the house.
L664915 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.
L664914 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?
L664910 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Who you workin' for? What do you do for a living, dickhead?
L664909 +++$+++ u9001 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ YORGI +++$+++ This pizda? Never seen him before.
L664908 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ That's the guy.
L664564 +++$+++ u9009 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ STORM +++$+++ Beast.
L664563 +++$+++ u9002 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ BEAST +++$+++ Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--
L664562 +++$+++ u9009 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ STORM +++$+++ We all do.
L664561 +++$+++ u9002 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ BEAST +++$+++ I wish I could go.
L664555 +++$+++ u9009 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ STORM +++$+++ ... until he found tungsten.
L664554 +++$+++ u9002 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ BEAST +++$+++ Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb.  He had the energy source. He had the vacuum.  But he didn't have the filament.  He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.
L664509 +++$+++ u9002 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ BEAST +++$+++ The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind.  It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions.
L664508 +++$+++ u9009 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ STORM +++$+++ What does that mean?
L664559 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?
L664558 +++$+++ u9002 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ BEAST +++$+++ Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
L664557 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ For what purpose?
L664556 +++$+++ u9002 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ BEAST +++$+++ Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.
L664553 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ Its core?
L664552 +++$+++ u9002 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ BEAST +++$+++ It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.
L664511 +++$+++ u9002 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ BEAST +++$+++ I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
L664510 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ Can the Professor repair his own mind?
L664610 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough.
L664609 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ Jean... can you?
L664595 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ Storm, Rogue, -- you take the south entrance.  Jean and I will go in here.
L664594 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ It's too far.
L664593 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission.  Jean, can you raise me up there?
L664575 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L664574 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Into the Hudson?
L664573 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ Radar Stealth Mode checks out.  All right, there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge.  I'm taking her down.
L664570 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ He calls me sport one more time, and I'll blow a watermelon-sized hole through him.
L664569 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ What's that?
L664568 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ I'll tell you one thing though.
L664567 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
L664566 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.
L664515 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
L664514 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Are you all right?
L664513 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ We have to find Magneto.
L664512 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ He's already losing control of his vitals.  Respiratory.  Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning, I'm afraid.
L664503 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
L664502 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ What's wrong with him?
L664396 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ If Magneto is planning to use Logan for some terrible purpose it's our responsibility to do something.
L664395 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.
L664394 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L664393 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ I don't like him being here.
L664392 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Scott.. I -
L664642 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ Sure you are, sport.
L664641 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I'm o.k.  I'm o.k.
L664427 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Shut up.  I got no interest in you, Xavier,  or your... X-Men.
L664426 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ You know, you --
L664425 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I've served with men like you before. Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You know what happens to those men in a real fight?
L664423 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I don't remember.  Is that what you wanted to ask me?
L664422 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ How long have you been in Alaska?
L664419 +++$+++ u9003 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ CYCLOPS +++$+++ I wanted to talk to you.
L664418 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?
L664482 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Yeah, I'll bet you have.
L664481 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I've seen a lot of rings.
L664480 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Logan, do you see this ring?
L664478 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me?
L664477 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ He takes himself seriously.
L664476 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ He takes his work seriously.
L664475 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ He's uptight.
L664474 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Suit yourself.
L664473 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Let go.
L664472 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Not interested.
L664471 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ What do you say?
L664470 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Were you now?
L664469 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
L664468 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ He's busy right now.
L664467 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ You should always work with a spotter.
L664390 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ What if they're naughty?
L664389 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ If necessary.
L664388 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ By reading my thoughts?
L664387 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
L664386 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
L664385 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary.
L664384 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ What if I like the pain?
L664383 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
L664382 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I won't light the cigars - how about that?
L664381 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
L664380 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Some cigars.  Case of beer.
L664379 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Anything else I can get you?
L664537 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
L664536 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change.
L664526 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Tell it to the ones that did this to me.
L664525 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us.
L664524 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey.  I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would...
L664519 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Senator?
L664518 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Dr. Grey.
L664268 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
L664267 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator.
L664266 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus, New Jersey.  A man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him.  I don't know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but where I come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off.  You do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger.  But what you presume to tell this committee -
L664265 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Control, Senator...  we teach them control.
L664264 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
L664263 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
L664262 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?
L664259 +++$+++ u9004 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ JEAN +++$+++ I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, Senator.  The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous.
L664258 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey.  Three words: Are mutants dangerous?
L664319 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ Let's just say, God works too slowly.
L664318 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ What is it you intend to do to me?
L664317 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We are talking about mankind here.  His fear.  It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.
L664316 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ The intention of registration act -
L664312 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ Gosh, I hope so.
L664311 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Whatever you do to me... no matter what you'll make me right.  Every word I have spoken will be confirmed.
L664310 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ You mutant bastards...
L664309 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
L664308 +++$+++ u9005 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?
L664580 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?
L664579 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L664578 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ You're backstage at the encore of creation.
L664577 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Where am I?
L664497 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
L664496 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ Come with me and I'll let her live.
L664495 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ What do you want?
L664494 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ I do love a good check mate.
L664654 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ What?... miss me?  Charley, I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me, it won't be soon enough for everyone here.
L664653 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ Why?  You have a home here now, if you want it.  Everyone will...
L664652 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Actually I'm feeling up to leaving.
L664651 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
L664650 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Don't you knock?
L664450 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I'll go.
L664449 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ I've found her, Westchester Mall.
L664447 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ We were friends once...  But that was a long time ago.
L664446 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ He helped you?
L664445 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
L664444 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ You designed this yourself?
L664443 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
L664442 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ How?
L664441 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ To find Rogue.
L664440 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Where are we going?
L664436 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ I believe he wants you for your Adamantium.
L664435 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ No.  That's me talking.  And you know what?  It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
L664434 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ Now that's Magneto talking.
L664433 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ What if it never happens?  What if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy? -- This place is gonna be one giant cemetery.
L664432 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ The point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility.  To recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings.
L664431 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ This.  This whole God damn thing.  Making yourselves into some sort of "team" of super-powered freaks. Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature.  For what?
L664430 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ The point of what?
L664371 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ Deal.
L664370 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Forty-eight hours, old man.  But if you cross me, I won't feel any guilt about what I do to you.
L664303 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.
L664302 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Who?
L664301 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
L664300 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ What am I doing here?
L664416 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ And you think it helps calling her Rogue?
L664415 +++$+++ u9009 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ STORM +++$+++ If she held on any longer she could have.
L664414 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I felt like she almost killed me.
L664413 +++$+++ u9009 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ STORM +++$+++ She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
L664412 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ What did she do to me?
L664411 +++$+++ u9009 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ STORM +++$+++ The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
L664410 +++$+++ u9006 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Why is everybody up at sunrise?
L664378 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ ALIVE.
L664377 +++$+++ u9008 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ SABRETOOTH +++$+++ I'll find him.
L664286 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ Enough for a test.
L664285 +++$+++ u9008 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ SABRETOOTH +++$+++ Is it enough?
L664284 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ A piece.  Only a piece.
L664283 +++$+++ u9008 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ SABRETOOTH +++$+++ Is that what you're looking for?
L664278 +++$+++ u9008 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ SABRETOOTH +++$+++ It was Xavier's people.  They knew.
L664277 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ How?
L664276 +++$+++ u9008 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ SABRETOOTH +++$+++ I lost him.
L664665 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.
L664664 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ And what do you do when you wake up to that?
L664663 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ It does indeed, Max.
L664662 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ Doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night?  The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children?  Take you all away?
L664661 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ I know.
L664660 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ I wouldn't really have let you die, you know.  I just needed...
L664365 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?
L664364 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ This checkmate goes to you.  I didn't want to hurt anyone.  But you leave me no choice.
L664363 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ What do you mean to do?
L664362 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles.  And this one gets a front row seat.
L664361 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ The way what is going to be?
L664360 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ If I could make you understand.  If you could just be made to see it the way I do.  The way it's going to be.
L664355 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake, for your sake...  Leave him to me.
L664354 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
L664353 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
L664352 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ Is that so?
L664350 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ What do you want with him?
L664349 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ The two in Alaska.  Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time?  Still tinkering with Cerebro?
L664346 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ Not at the cost of lives, Max.
L664345 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
L664344 +++$+++ u9010 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ XAVIER +++$+++ And I'll never understand terrorists.
L664343 +++$+++ u9007 +++$+++ m614 +++$+++ MAGNETO +++$+++ I'll never understand your regard for them, Charles.
L665374 +++$+++ u9014 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ CORNELIUS WALDMAN +++$+++ Herr Falkstein -- you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance.  The estate will provide for your journey.
L665373 +++$+++ u9011 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ANASTASIA +++$+++ Oh, shit.
L665372 +++$+++ u9014 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ CORNELIUS WALDMAN +++$+++ He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
L665371 +++$+++ u9011 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ANASTASIA +++$+++ And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
L665370 +++$+++ u9014 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ CORNELIUS WALDMAN +++$+++ Yes, my dear, he is.
L665369 +++$+++ u9011 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ANASTASIA +++$+++ Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
L666093 +++$+++ u9012 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ BURGOMEISTER +++$+++ Now wait a minute!
L666092 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I think we all need a good night's sleep.  Why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out?
L666088 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Poppycock!
L666087 +++$+++ u9012 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ BURGOMEISTER +++$+++ They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village.  What say you to that?
L666086 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Ugly, vicious rumous.
L666085 +++$+++ u9012 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ BURGOMEISTER +++$+++ Forgive me for intruding so late at night, Herr Baron.  But an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle.  These good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears.  How say you?
L666084 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Victor Frankenstein.
L666083 +++$+++ u9012 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ BURGOMEISTER +++$+++ What was your grandfather's name?
L666082 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ No!
L666081 +++$+++ u9012 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ BURGOMEISTER +++$+++ The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
L666080 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
L666079 +++$+++ u9012 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ BURGOMEISTER +++$+++ And who might you be?
L666078 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ You have the wrong house.
L666077 +++$+++ u9012 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ BURGOMEISTER +++$+++ Frederick Frankenstein?
L665456 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ ... No!
L665455 +++$+++ u9013 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ CARLSON +++$+++ Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
L665454 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
L665453 +++$+++ u9013 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ CARLSON +++$+++ Yes, sir?
L665452 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Carlson!
L665435 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being.
L665434 +++$+++ u9013 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ CARLSON +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L665424 +++$+++ u9013 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ CARLSON +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L665423 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Give him an extra dollar.
L665406 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Here!  This cauliflower is useless to me.
L665405 +++$+++ u9013 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ CARLSON +++$+++ No, sir.  It will never happen again.
L665404 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Are you trying to make me look like an idiot?
L665403 +++$+++ u9013 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ CARLSON +++$+++ Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
L665402 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
L665401 +++$+++ u9013 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ CARLSON +++$+++ From your office, sir.
L665400 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Where did you get this cauliflower?
L665379 +++$+++ u9014 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ CORNELIUS WALDMAN +++$+++ I have taken an oath that each letter of this testament shall be executed...and by God, it shall be done!
L665378 +++$+++ u9018 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ HERR FALKSTEIN +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L665377 +++$+++ u9014 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ CORNELIUS WALDMAN +++$+++ Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
L665368 +++$+++ u9018 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ HERR FALKSTEIN +++$+++ 'Functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull.'
L665367 +++$+++ u9014 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ CORNELIUS WALDMAN +++$+++ What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
L665366 +++$+++ u9018 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ HERR FALKSTEIN +++$+++ Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.
L665365 +++$+++ u9014 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ CORNELIUS WALDMAN +++$+++ Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
L665364 +++$+++ u9018 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ HERR FALKSTEIN +++$+++ But I received a cable only this morning, saying that he could not come.
L665363 +++$+++ u9018 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ HERR FALKSTEIN +++$+++ I did, sir.
L665362 +++$+++ u9014 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ CORNELIUS WALDMAN +++$+++ Herr Falkstein!  Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
L666203 +++$+++ u9023 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MONSTER +++$+++ MMmmm.
L666202 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
L666201 +++$+++ u9023 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MONSTER +++$+++ MMmmm.
L666200 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Love me oodles and oodles?
L666199 +++$+++ u9023 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MONSTER +++$+++ MMmmm.
L666198 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Still happy you married me?
L666197 +++$+++ u9023 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MONSTER +++$+++ MMmmm.
L666196 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts.  the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies.
L666130 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.
L666129 +++$+++ u9023 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MONSTER +++$+++ MMMMM!  MMMMM!
L666128 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Is it that music?
L666127 +++$+++ u9023 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MONSTER +++$+++ MMMmm!
L666125 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ All right then... seven's always been my lucky number.
L666124 +++$+++ u9023 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MONSTER +++$+++ MMMmmmm.
L666123 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?
L666119 +++$+++ u9023 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MONSTER +++$+++ Baack!
L666118 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ What?
L666117 +++$+++ u9023 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MONSTER +++$+++ Baack!
L666116 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ What in God's name are you doing?
L665976 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ I...
L665975 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Miss me?
L665974 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Well... yes.
L665973 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Surprised?
L665972 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Hello...?
L665971 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Darling!
L666017 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ That's my good boy.
L666016 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Good night.
L666015 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
L666014 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I suppose you're right.
L666013 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Is it worth taking a chance?
L666012 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ That's a tough choice.
L666011 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
L666010 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off.
L666009 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Oh, darling!  Don't let's spoil everything.
L666008 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
L666007 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?
L666005 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy.
L666004 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I suppose you're right.
L666003 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
L666002 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
L666001 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
L666000 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ But there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships.  I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system.
L665999 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Darling, you mustn't worry so.
L665998 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Poor Delbruck!  There must be some way to reach him -- to control that body.
L665986 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ All right then!
L665985 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ No, of course not.  I just meant...
L665984 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Are you suggesting I call him master???
L665983 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Why does he call you 'master'?
L665982 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
L665981 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ What a strange fellow.
L665979 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Give me a hand with these, will you, Ayegor?
L665978 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
L665977 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Ready, darling?
L665968 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants:  Inga and Ayegor.
L665967 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Darling!?!
L665966 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?
L665965 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Love me?
L665964 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Surprised!
L665963 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Surprised?
L665962 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Darling!
L665961 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Darling!
L665523 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Goodbye, darling!
L665522 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Goodbye, darling.
L665521 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Goodbye, darling.
L665520 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I will!  Goodbye, darling!
L665515 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ You bet your boots it does.
L665514 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Does that mean you love me?
L665513 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ You're incorrigible!
L665512 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
L665511 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Whatever makes you happy.
L665510 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ I hope you like large weddings.
L665509 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Oh, nice.
L665508 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
L665507 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Very....very!
L665506 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Will you miss me?
L665503 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Oh, darling -- so will I.
L665502 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
L665501 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I promise.
L665500 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Promise??
L665499 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yes.
L665498 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Call me from New York before you leave??
L665497 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yes, don't worry.
L665496 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ And your passport?
L665495 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yes.
L665494 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ You have your tickets?
L665493 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Of course.
L665492 +++$+++ u9015 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Darling!...you will be careful!?
L665956 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Elizabeth!?!  'Can't waits any longer.  Arrive in your arms at ten tonight.' Oh, God!  Not tonight.
L665955 +++$+++ u9016 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FRAU BLUCHER +++$+++ This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
L665954 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?
L665614 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Good.
L665613 +++$+++ u9016 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FRAU BLUCHER +++$+++ I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
L665612 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?
L665611 +++$+++ u9016 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FRAU BLUCHER +++$+++ Will there be anything else?
L665610 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Well... we'll see.
L665609 +++$+++ u9016 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FRAU BLUCHER +++$+++ I think you must be mistaken, sir.
L665608 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
L665607 +++$+++ u9016 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FRAU BLUCHER +++$+++ This is the only library I know of.
L665606 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.
L665605 +++$+++ u9016 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FRAU BLUCHER +++$+++ I don't know what you mean, sir.
L665604 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?
L665603 +++$+++ u9016 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FRAU BLUCHER +++$+++ Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
L665602 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ There seem to be quite a few books.
L665600 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ May I have it, please?
L665599 +++$+++ u9016 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FRAU BLUCHER +++$+++ No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
L665598 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yes!... the laboratory.
L665597 +++$+++ u9016 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FRAU BLUCHER +++$+++ You mean... the laboratory??
L665596 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Does that include the key to the laboratory?
L665595 +++$+++ u9016 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FRAU BLUCHER +++$+++ You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.
L665594 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ It seems fine.
L665593 +++$+++ u9016 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FRAU BLUCHER +++$+++ I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.
L665491 +++$+++ u9018 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ HERR FALKSTEIN +++$+++ Saturday night, yes, sir.  Have a pleasant journey!
L665490 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
L665489 +++$+++ u9018 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ HERR FALKSTEIN +++$+++ Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor.
L665488 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Well, thank you very much for all your trouble.
L665487 +++$+++ u9018 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ HERR FALKSTEIN +++$+++ One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
L665486 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ One week at the most!?
L665485 +++$+++ u9018 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ HERR FALKSTEIN +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L665484 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much.  You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?
L665482 +++$+++ u9018 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ HERR FALKSTEIN +++$+++ The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
L665481 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I didn't do that.
L665480 +++$+++ u9018 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ HERR FALKSTEIN +++$+++ Break that old man's violin.
L665479 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ What?
L665478 +++$+++ u9018 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ HERR FALKSTEIN +++$+++ Why did you do that?
L665477 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Well... if you're sure that I could accomplish everything in a week... I suppose I could manage it.
L665466 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I'll have to think it over.  It's not so easy just to pick up and...
L665465 +++$+++ u9018 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ HERR FALKSTEIN +++$+++ A week.  Ten days at most.
L665464 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ How long will this whole thing take?
L665463 +++$+++ u9018 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ HERR FALKSTEIN +++$+++ Do you have a hundred thousand of them, sir?
L665462 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ But I can't just drop everything and leave.  I have responsibilities and obligations.
L665461 +++$+++ u9018 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ HERR FALKSTEIN +++$+++ Oh, at least, sir.  The land alone is worth a small fortune.
L665459 +++$+++ u9018 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ HERR FALKSTEIN +++$+++ My name is Gerhart Falkstein.
L665458 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Fron kon steen!
L665457 +++$+++ u9018 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ HERR FALKSTEIN +++$+++ Dr. Frankenstein?
L665450 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ My grandfather's work was Doo-Doo! Dead is Dead!  There's only one thing I am interested in... and that is the preservation of LIFE!
L665449 +++$+++ u9022 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MEDICAL STUDENT +++$+++ But your grandfather's work, sir...
L665448 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ You have more chance of re-animating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system,
L665447 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I am a scientist...!  not a philosopher.
L665446 +++$+++ u9022 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MEDICAL STUDENT +++$+++ But, sir...
L665445 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
L665444 +++$+++ u9022 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MEDICAL STUDENT +++$+++ But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
L665443 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
L665442 +++$+++ u9022 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MEDICAL STUDENT +++$+++ Nineteen, sir.
L665441 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ How old are you, young man?
L665440 +++$+++ u9022 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MEDICAL STUDENT +++$+++ Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
L665439 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind.
L665438 +++$+++ u9022 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MEDICAL STUDENT +++$+++ But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
L665437 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ My father was a sick man.
L665436 +++$+++ u9022 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MEDICAL STUDENT +++$+++ But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the re-animation of component parts?
L665431 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.
L665430 +++$+++ u9022 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MEDICAL STUDENT +++$+++ Vermicelli.
L665429 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ A piece of what?
L665428 +++$+++ u9022 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MEDICAL STUDENT +++$+++ Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?
L665427 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yes?
L665426 +++$+++ u9022 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MEDICAL STUDENT +++$+++ Dr. Fronkonsteen!
L665425 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?
L665394 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Very good!  Since our lab work today is a demonstration of just that distinction... why don't we proceed?
L665393 +++$+++ u9022 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MEDICAL STUDENT +++$+++ Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
L665392 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I prefer, by far, to be remembered for my own small contributions to science.  Now if we can proceed to your questions.
L665391 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ That's true!  But my grandfather, Victor was, after all, what we might politely refer to as... a cuckoo!
L665390 +++$+++ u9022 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MEDICAL STUDENT +++$+++ But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
L665389 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!
L665388 +++$+++ u9022 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MEDICAL STUDENT +++$+++ Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
L665387 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
L665386 +++$+++ u9022 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MEDICAL STUDENT +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
L665385 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ That's 'Fronkonsteen.'
L666138 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Okay, boss!  But I hope you know what you're doing.
L666137 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ It's the only way.
L666136 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?
L666135 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Is everything ready?
L666134 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Come on, big fellow!
L666104 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ I'll bet it's a doozy.
L666103 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ There's only one way.
L666102 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
L666101 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ ... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
L666100 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ That sound good, boss.
L666099 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
L666096 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ He's carrying her off now through the woods.
L666095 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ What???
L666094 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ You don't understand, Master. The big fellow's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee.
L666091 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ What d'ya mean "What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.
L666090 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ What monster?
L665948 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Come on, Froderick -- none of that.
L665947 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I'm a failure.
L665907 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ That's what we're paid for.
L665906 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Thanks...for all your help.
L665884 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Maybe...if you get here on time.
L665883 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Can you play it?
L665882 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Bring -- me -- the -- violin!
L665881 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ How do you know it was a 'she'?
L665880 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ All right -- where is she?
L665879 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ How do you know it was a 'he'?
L665878 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Where is he?
L665877 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Someone was playing this in the music room.
L665876 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ What did you find out?
L665875 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ How's it going?
L665855 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Act casual!
L665854 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Yes, Master!
L665853 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
L665852 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ It seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks.
L665835 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ ... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
L665834 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ No, no!  That whole thing!
L665833 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ ... I'm glad that's...
L665832 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.
L665831 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I'm not trying to be funny.
L665830 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.
L665829 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Why?
L665828 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
L665827 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yes.
L665826 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ You can say that again.
L665825 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
L665824 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Give -- me -- your -- hand!
L665823 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Original.
L665810 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.
L665809 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
L665808 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Don't fall for that one.
L665807 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ It's trying to talk.  it wants us to take off the straps.
L665806 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I suppose you're right.  Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case.
L665805 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Better not get too close, master. This guy could kill you.
L665797 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ It wasn't me.
L665796 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ But you did -- I just heard it.
L665795 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
L665794 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
L665793 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Who are you talking to?
L665792 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Oh, do you like it?  I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.
L665789 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ You're right!  Self-pity never got anyone anywhere.  Let's go back and finish our dinner.
L665788 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ I'm not that sort you know.  I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way.
L665787 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.
L665786 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ You'll be getting me sad next.
L665785 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Well, I don't like to see you mope.
L665784 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Don't try to cheer me up that way.
L665783 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.
L665782 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Cold!  Cold and dead!
L665779 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.
L665778 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ You can't win 'em all.
L665772 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Wait till he sees the bill.
L665771 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Throw the third switch!
L665770 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ What?
L665769 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ More, do you hear me?
L665768 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ What?
L665767 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ It's not enough.  More!  More, do you hear me?
L665766 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ This guy means business.
L665765 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Throw the second switch!
L665761 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ You've got it, master.
L665760 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yes!  When I give the word -- throw the first switch!
L665759 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Tonight?
L665758 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ The ancient masters promised impossibilities and performed nothing.  We shall penetrate into the recesses of nature.  We shall ascend into the Heavens.  We shall command the thunders of Heaven, mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.
L665754 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ All right... elevate me!
L665753 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ You'd better hurry -- I think it's going to rain.
L665747 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Yes, master.  Just don't turn on any radios.
L665746 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yes!  It's all written down in the notes.  Tie off the kites and come down!
L665745 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ You're sure you know what you're doing?
L665736 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Thank you, Master.
L665735 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ If you like -- just hurry!
L665734 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ It's always been one of my favorite names.
L665733 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Why?
L665732 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Oh!  May I call you 'Master'?
L665731 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.
L665730 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?
L665729 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Can you imagine that brain in this body?
L665728 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ That's not bad.
L665727 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
L665726 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Hmm!
L665725 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Was he any good???  He was the finest natural philosopher, internal medicine diagnostician and chemical therapist of this century.
L665724 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Was he any good?
L665723 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I want that brain.
L665722 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
L665721 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Do you have the name I wrote down?
L665720 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ I have a pretty good idea.
L665719 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Very little decay.  With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain.  You know what to do!
L665714 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Could be raining!
L665713 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ How?
L665712 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Could be worse!
L665711 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ What a filthy job!
L665679 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yes, I think we could all use a good laugh.
L665678 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Taking the book along?
L665674 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Funny it should just be lying out here on the table.  I wonder what kind of dribble this is?
L665673 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ 'How I Did It.'  Good title!
L665672 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this!
L665669 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Must be the music room.
L665668 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ What is this place?
L665662 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ No, but when I first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door.
L665661 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Did you see anyone else down here?
L665656 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
L665655 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
L665654 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ What?
L665653 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?
L665650 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Did you hear that strange music?
L665649 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ What?
L665648 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Did you hear that strange music??
L665647 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ What?
L665646 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Did you hear that strange music?
L665645 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Just putting up some tea.
L665644 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ But what you were doing?
L665643 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came down here.
L665642 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L665641 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Fro-derick!
L665640 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Aye-gor!
L665585 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I wonder what's got into them?
L665584 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Down!  Get down, you beasts!
L665580 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Home.
L665579 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Home!
L665577 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Go ahead, play dumb!  You'll lose your sockers and then be fockers.
L665576 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Wockers with the knockers???
L665575 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ The wockers with the knockers.
L665574 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ What wockers?
L665573 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
L665572 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ No.
L665571 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ I thought you wanted to.
L665570 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Why are you talking like that?
L665569 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ There wolf!  There castle!
L665568 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
L665567 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ There.
L665562 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ What hump?
L665561 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Incidentally -- I don't mean to embarrass you in any way, but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon.  Perhaps I can help you with that hump.
L665551 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yes, just the two.
L665550 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Are these your bags?
L665547 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ How do you do?
L665546 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ This is Inga.  They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
L665545 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I'm sure we will.
L665544 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Yes, that's right.  My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together.  You and I should have a lot of laughs.
L665543 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
L665542 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
L665541 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ But they told me it was Ee gor.
L665540 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ No, it's pronounced Aye gor.
L665539 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ You must be Igor.
L665538 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ I see.
L665537 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
L665536 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
L665535 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ No, Fred ereck.
L665534 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ And do you also say Fro dereck?
L665533 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
L665532 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Are you putting me on?
L665531 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Fron kon steen!
L665530 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Frederick Frankenstein?
L665945 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Don't you think I know that?  But what are you judging by?  Bucharest??? This was always a hick town.  They can't get a 'Bus and Truck' company to come in here.  Are you going to let these idiots get the best of you? ...Or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you've got more dignity in your little finger than they've got in all their beer- bloated bodies put together?
L665944 +++$+++ u9023 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MONSTER +++$+++ MMMmmmmmm.
L665943 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Wait!  Stop!  Don't give them the satisfaction.  I know it's tough, but look at how far we've come! Are you going to throw it all away now??
L665942 +++$+++ u9023 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MONSTER +++$+++ MMMMMMMMMM! MMMMMMMMMMMM!

L665818 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yes, I'm going to set you free.  Is the sedative ready?
L665817 +++$+++ u9023 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ MONSTER +++$+++ MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm!
L665816 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I'm going to untie you -- can you understand that?

L665475 +++$+++ u9024 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ OLD VIOLINIST +++$+++ Ja, ja.
L665474 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Nice!  Nice little balance to it.
L665473 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Oh, just a little.
L665472 +++$+++ u9024 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ OLD VIOLINIST +++$+++ It's an honor for me, sir.  You play the violin?
L665471 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ May I see your violin?
L665470 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ How sweet!  Such a quaint little tune.
L665469 +++$+++ u9024 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ OLD VIOLINIST +++$+++ Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
L665468 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ What's that tune that you're playing
L666222 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
L666221 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Sweetheart.....Is this really you???
L666220 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ I love it when you're excited.  Come then, my Apfelstrudel!  Come into my arms and let me hold you.
L666219 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
L666218 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Ready for Fuchsmachen???
L666217 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ MMMMmmmmm!
L666216 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Are you ready for me?
L666215 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Yes, sweetie...I heard you.  So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.
L666214 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ MMMMmmmmm!
L666211 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ MMmmm.
L666210 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ All right if I turn out the lamp, sweetheart?
L666076 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ ...But an intellectual relationship, like this -- we could have as often as we wanted.  Three times a day -- anything!
L666075 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Yes, I will.
L666074 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ You've got to help me to remain faithful.
L666073 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Yes, I know.
L666072 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ It wouldn't be fair to her.
L666071 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Yes, I know.
L666045 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Well...  ... perhaps for a few minutes.
L666044 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Why don't we talk inside?
L666043 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yes...yes, you have yours.
L666042 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ And I have mine.
L666041 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yes, I have mine.
L666040 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ But, after all, you have yours.
L666039 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
L666038 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ And Elizabeth has hers.
L666036 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ We all have our feelings.  I know that I have mine.  And... I wouldn't want to hurt yours.
L666035 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
L666034 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Nor to Elizabeth.
L666033 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
L666032 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ What?
L666030 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Of course not.
L666029 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.
L666028 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ I know Frederick.
L666027 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
L666026 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ I see what you mean.
L666025 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
L666024 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Not fooling around.
L666023 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ It's terrible -- the price society demands in the name of fidelity... ultimately?
L666022 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ I've missed you intellectually, too, Doctor.
L666021 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Oh, a little.  But it's not just physical loneliness.  It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you.
L666020 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.
L666019 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Just passing through the night.
L665958 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!
L665957 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.
L665905 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Good night!
L665904 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Good night, Doctor.
L665898 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Good!  It shouldn't take more than a few seconds.
L665897 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ I think so.
L665896 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Did you do it?
L665894 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
L665893 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Give him the sedative!
L665892 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Are you serious??
L665891 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ All right -- give it to him!
L665874 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Stop -- singing!!!
L665873 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ It has a pas-sion, 'The Con-ti nen-tal...'
L665870 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ It's some-thing dar-ing, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal,' A way of danc-ing that's real-ly ul-tra new; It's ver-y sub-tle, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal.'
L665869 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ This is not the finals -- just sing!
L665868 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ I'd be so nervous.
L665867 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Yes -- quickly, dear!
L665866 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Me?  Sing?
L665865 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Do you think you can sing it?
L665862 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I think I'll...carry him.
L665861 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L665841 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ What do you think we should do?
L665840 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ It looks that way.
L665804 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Alive!  Look at it.  I have defeated death!
L665803 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ I think you've done it, master.

L665692 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ And look at this, Doctor!
L665691 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ 'As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a gigantic stature.' Of course!  That would simplify everything.
L665677 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Perhaps we'd better leave.
L665676 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Oh, doctor!
L665665 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ But who was playing it?
L665664 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Well, this explains the music.

L665637 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.
L665636 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!
L665633 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ I don't know.  It just woke me up.

L665631 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
L665630 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?

L665622 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Well.. I suppose it would be all right, for just a little while.
L665621 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
L665620 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Well...
L665619 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room.
L665618 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ We only arrived a few minutes ago.
L665617 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Could I lie down in your bed for a little while?  I just can't sleep.
L665616 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
L665615 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Are you busy?
L665565 +++$+++ u9017 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ FREDDY +++$+++ Just an atmospheric discharge. Nothing to be afraid of.

L666159 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Absolutely!  May my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth.
L666158 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain?  Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night?
L666156 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid!  I just hope this all ends well.
L666155 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ What d'ya want to do to kill time?
L666154 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Yes.

L666150 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ The doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.
L666149 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ How do you know they're done?
L665952 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?
L665951 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
L665950 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
L665949 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Look how far we've come.
L665901 +++$+++ u9019 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ IGOR +++$+++ Why don't we all turn in?  It's been a long day.
L665900 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ I'm getting tired.

L665885 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ It's working!  Oh, Doctor -- you play beautifully.

L665652 +++$+++ u9020 +++$+++ m615 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ There must have been someone else down here then.

L666398 +++$+++ u9027 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CHELMSFORD +++$+++ My only fear is that the Zulu will avoid the engagement
L666397 +++$+++ u9032 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ NORRIS-NEWMAN +++$+++ So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction.
L666396 +++$+++ u9027 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CHELMSFORD +++$+++ Do not confuse yourse{fi Why? We must strike a heavy blow. This cannot be a war of manoeuvre.

L666393 +++$+++ u9032 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ NORRIS-NEWMAN +++$+++ They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord.
L666392 +++$+++ u9027 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CHELMSFORD +++$+++ Were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?
L666391 +++$+++ u9032 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ NORRIS-NEWMAN +++$+++ Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross.

L666484 +++$+++ u9030 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ DURNFORD +++$+++ I'm explaining my reasons.
L666483 +++$+++ u9027 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CHELMSFORD +++$+++ Are you dictating the strategy of this war, Sir?
L666482 +++$+++ u9027 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CHELMSFORD +++$+++ Intelligence? Sources of your own? Did it not occur to you they may be native rumours? Rumours to draw you off- to leave the whole ofNatal open to a possible counter thrust
L666481 +++$+++ u9030 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ DURNFORD +++$+++ I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
L666480 +++$+++ u9027 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CHELMSFORD +++$+++ You intended to bring your reserves across the river?
L666358 +++$+++ u9030 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ DURNFORD +++$+++ My Lord.  This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value.
L666357 +++$+++ u9027 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CHELMSFORD +++$+++ Excellent. Thank you.  Give them to Crealock, would you?
L666250 +++$+++ u9030 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ DURNFORD +++$+++ I thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.
L666249 +++$+++ u9027 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CHELMSFORD +++$+++ Oh... indeed. Crealock, we should see that Colonel Dumford has an Officer for his hard riders. Perhaps a subaltern from the Twenty Fourth.
L666248 +++$+++ u9027 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CHELMSFORD +++$+++ They come well recommended do they? DURNFORD

L666461 +++$+++ u9027 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CHELMSFORD +++$+++ Thank you.
L666460 +++$+++ u9029 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CREALOCK +++$+++ The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.
L666385 +++$+++ u9027 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CHELMSFORD +++$+++ Our runners bare his dispatches, do they not?
L666384 +++$+++ u9029 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CREALOCK +++$+++ Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from "The Standard".
L666383 +++$+++ u9027 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CHELMSFORD +++$+++ What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?
L666252 +++$+++ u9027 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CHELMSFORD +++$+++ But will they make good use of them?
L666251 +++$+++ u9029 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ CREALOCK +++$+++ Yes. I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.
L666502 +++$+++ u9033 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ STUART SMITH +++$+++ Right.  Bombardier, to me please.
L666501 +++$+++ u9028 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ COGHILL +++$+++ Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in position immediately. .
L666500 +++$+++ u9033 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ STUART SMITH +++$+++ Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
L666499 +++$+++ u9028 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ COGHILL +++$+++ How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
L666498 +++$+++ u9033 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ STUART SMITH +++$+++ Yes.

L666325 +++$+++ u9031 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ MELVILL +++$+++ Which one?
L666324 +++$+++ u9028 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ COGHILL +++$+++ Do you think she might be interested in  someone?
L666264 +++$+++ u9031 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ MELVILL +++$+++ Well that's typical of Her Majesty's army. Appoint an engineer to do a soldier's work.
L666263 +++$+++ u9028 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ COGHILL +++$+++ Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
L666262 +++$+++ u9031 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ MELVILL +++$+++ Lighting COGHILL' 5 cigar: Our good Colonel Dumford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.
L666522 +++$+++ u9034 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ VEREKER +++$+++ So far only their scouts. But we have had reports of a small Impi farther north, over there. 
L666521 +++$+++ u9030 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ DURNFORD +++$+++ And I assure you, you do not In fact I'd be obliged for your best advice. What have your scouts seen?
L666520 +++$+++ u9034 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ VEREKER +++$+++ Well I assure you, Sir, I have no desire to create difficulties. 45
L666372 +++$+++ u9034 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ VEREKER +++$+++ I think Chelmsford wants a good man on the border Why he fears a flanking attack and requires a steady Commander in reserve.
L666371 +++$+++ u9030 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ DURNFORD +++$+++ Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
L666370 +++$+++ u9034 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ VEREKER +++$+++ I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
L666369 +++$+++ u9030 +++$+++ m616 +++$+++ DURNFORD +++$+++ Your orders, Mr Vereker?
