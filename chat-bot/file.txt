i was being foolish
i know
there was a time when i would have welcomed it

whacking is not of much use on a farm
i can whack people im hell at whacking
what else can you do
i did some carpentry summers when i was going to school
you know carpentry
a real fireball
we had some lemonade and he left
oh  what happened to hochstetler
eli is a fine carpenter best in the district he and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago
oh the bullets
the bullets

anything against zippers
vain proud such a person is hochmutsnarr he is not plain
hochmut
buttons are hochmut
something wrong with buttons
i should tell you these do not have buttons  see hooks and eyes
yes its good that someone can have the use of them besides in your clothes youd stand out to strangers
your husbands
your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood i have them soakingyou can wear these
very interesting im learning a lot about manure  whats that
enjoying your reading
its not the gun dont you understand its you what you stand for  that is not for samuel
nobody meant any harm the boy was curious i unloaded the gun 
john book i would appreciate it if during the time you are with us you would have as little to do with samuel as possible
you tell him when youre able
tell him his tea stinks
but you cant
listen thank you thanks for everything but ive got to go
two days
how long have i been here
what
how long
only the elders
does anybody know im here
can i have something to drink
the leadership of our district the diener bishop tschantz is the one with no hair on top they decided to come and see you for themselves except stoltzfus of course he came the first day i think he saved your life
who are they
but –
gunshot theyll file reports theyll find me
but why
no no doctor
but john why didnt you go to a hospital
what about samuel will you come back to take him to trial
i cant
stay for awhile rest ill make coffee and breakfast
i was wrong
you said we would be safe in philadelphia
you couldnt wait until morning
home
where are you taking us now
youll be safe you dont have to worry
im afraid im afraid for samuel i want to go home
because – somehow – they knew i was getting close  look its narcotics they make dope out of chemicals they sell it on the street for millions of dollars theyll do anything  and they can get away with it because theyre cops
but why would they murder
listen im the cop that polices the police im not in the business of protecting crooked cops  ill make an arrest when i know everybody involved
why dont you arrest that man are you protecting him because policeman
oh yes she thinks you like policing because you think youre right about everything and youre the only one who can do anything and that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a um bag of elbows
oh anything else
she thinks you should get married and have children of your own instead of trying to be a father to hers except she thinks youre afraid of the responsibility
no
your sister said you dont have a family
whats a good tired tired is tired
but not a good tired
i would not be too sure
they kid a lot
no youre not –  youre glad because now youve got a witness  i heard the other police talking last night  they dont seem to like you very much
look im genuinely sorry
people who dont go into our courts when theyre told to sometimes go directly into our jail
we do not go into your courts
believe me im trying to get this over with as fast as i can but samuel will probably have to come back and testify
yes and i also want to leave this city
whacking
the problem is i dont happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people
now whats the problem
he wants to know who you are your name i told him we dont need to know anything about you
what was that
its not a joke
doesnt surprise me i meet a lot of people like that
you dont understand we have nothing to do with your laws
yes i do your son is a material witness to a homicide
you have no right to keep us here
were looking for a suspect weve reason to believe hes still in the area
where are you taking us
therell be another train  the man who was killed tonight was a policeman sam its my job to find out who did it i want you to tell me everything you saw when you went in there
samuel samuel lapp  but what happened here is none of his affair my sister is expecting me our train is leaving soon

elaine i dont want to have to take you in for questioning youve got his car you were the last to see him –
better you should get off my front porch before i get my mace

its empty the tinsmith forgot to give me a heart
beautiful  what an echo
well you cant  as for you my fine friend  youre a victim of disorganized thinking  you are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger you have no courage  youre confusing courage with wisdom  back where i come from we have men who are called heroes  once a year they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city  and they have no more courage than you have  but they have one thing that you havent got a medal  therefore  for meritorious
how can i ever thank you enough
thd
therefore by virtue of the authority vested in me by the universitatus committeeatum e plurbis unum i hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of thd
you promised us real things  a real
well 
well i 
 and the courage that you promised cowardly lion
well i 
what about the heart that you promised tin man 
well i 
what about us
yes
it makes you nervous
uh  now please dont be angry with me ill  ill do anything you say only only if you dont shout at me it makes me nervous
help
 ruined my exit
oh  help me the balloons going up
this is a highly irregular procedure this is absolutely unprecedented
stop that dog
yes  
but i still want one
as for you my galvanized friend you want a heart you dont know how lucky you are not to have one hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable i could have been a world figure a power among men a  a successful wizard had i not been obstructed by a heart
so isn’t it time you unwrapped your present
i love christmas in turkey
we can’t
we’ve got to get out
count to twenty  i’ll be there
but what if
count to twenty  when you get to twenty open the hatch  it can only be opened for a few seconds or we’ll sink
just wanted to put him on edge
what kind of bikes did you ride
like riding a bike
do you know what you’re doing
he’s going to insert the plutonium
he’s sealed himself in
we go down to the torpedo bay
is there another way
if i don’t get to the boa before he gets to maiden’s tower m is dead
zukovsky
elektra would control it all
the king pipeline
because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines there would be only one way to get the oil out of the caspian and pump it to the world
but why eight million people would die the land irradiated for a hundred years a cloud of radiation the size of europe
made to look just like an accident
not just nuclear powered by a nuclear reactor  he’s not loading any cargo they want the sub the sub itself put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub’s reactor: instant catastrophic meltdown
nuclear
she just upped the stakes all her chips are on the table now  and m’s life is part of the bet
what is it
i was hoping you could tell me
what would she want with weapons grade plutonium
makes her look even more innocent
elektra king  are you insane  this is her pipeline
elektra king
who’s she
it’s part of some plan she dresses it up like a terrorist attack  the explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium
what the hell are you talking about
i did kill us she thinks we’re dead and she thinks she got away with it
what the hell were you doing  you nearly killed us
it’s a bomb alright we’re still dead if the trigger charge goes off
then it’s no longer a bomb
the plutonium is missing  they’ve taken the core
alright then brunch
when this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens
when this is over we should bury the hatchet celebrate a champagne dinner
with this
they won’t get far every warhead has a locator card  a miratom device  emits a highpitched signal on russian emergency frequencies we can track the bomb
bond 
so who are you
shame you had to spot i wasn’t the real thing
here’s your imposter he’s paid off the men on the plane outside  they’re not taking the bomb to any russian facility they’re flying it wherever he tells them
he is an impostor  there’s no davidov at miratom
the soldiers may give you a hard time whatever if we weren’t around they’d have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides rotting in the sun
couldn’t make it splitting headache
what happened to len tashka
don’t know any doctor jokes
doctor jones christmas jones no jokes i’ve heard them all
yes viktor davidov miss
you new
i could come for a second opinion
yes
perhaps after this  test
then maybe i’d be open to that
james  it wouldn’t really be
it’s just a scratch
i need you to pass me fit now molly
dislocated collar bone  if any more tendons snap  it won’t just be two weeks out of action
is maybethe inside woman
the inside man
they’re getting their weapons from the russians but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons  i can’t help thinkingthe person close to king the one who switched that pin
then robert was right about a russian connection
the report king bought it’s a manual renard’s men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead
the worm on the hook again
get out to the pipeline find the insider who switched the pin if your instincts are right renard will be back he hasn’t completed the job the pipeline is still going forward and we have elektra to thank for that
he’s not through yet renard doesn’t blow up five million dollars unless he knows there’s more coming in he’s working for someone someone who wants to stop the pipeline  and they hired the perfect killer one with a vendetta against kingand you
now robert is dead he got his revenge
‘that which does not kill me makes me stronger’
the bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata killing off his sense of touch he feels no pain he can push himself harder longer than any normal man
the doctor who saved him couldn’t get it out so renard killed him when interpol found the xrays there was mild jubilation effectively he’s a dead man
he survived
how many deaths is he responsible for how many innocent people you may only get one shot at a man like renard same circumstances i’d do the same again
sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist
sir robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his ownresources at first when elektra’s ear was delivered to him in the post he came to me  i advised against paying the ransom i knew it was renard i played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him
renard
claude serrault  aka
who
it’s a message  he wants us to know he’s back
the amount of money that killed robert king is the same amount as the ransom demand for elektra
i’m well aware of your stake in this 007 if you have a point get to it
i was the one who brought that money in
you haven’t been given an assignment in this case
i took the initiative
who told you to look at elektra’s files
and now it’s up for grabs a goldrush far more oil than anyone thought
caviar capital of the world matchless beluga firm yet subtle  largest landlocked body of water on earth  oilrich  hitler wanted it stalin beat him to it
007 what do you know of the caspian sea
well at least it turned out to have some purpose
it’s barely a scratch the dome broke my fall
i’ve scheduled a medical for you
she’s not a girl anymore
elektra  running king industries  i’ve known that girl all her life i’m not sure she knows what she’s walking into
who buys classified reports for three million pounds
since oxford i knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world he’s a man of great integrity
old friend
quite the opposite in fact
construction’s not exactly my line
i can’t tell you  alright alright but you must protect me
the name
stripped of all your weaponry you still threaten me
your last chance give me the name
your last chance take the money
and we know how difficult that can be for the swiss
i am just a middle man i am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner
who did you get it from
i did not get the report from an mi6 agent
which is neutral no doubt
not the usual swiss procedure mr bond but you understand a man in my position
haven’t you heard the news  so is she
in case you’ve forgotten  i’m dead already
you even brought the plane for us  we really couldn’t have done it without you
she’ll get over it
it’s i who should thank you  for taking that money back to mi6  so distressing for m  an explosion inside her lair
consider me ungrateful
have you forgotten who saved your life in geneva
you will never touch her you will never get near her
you think i fear death i welcome it i get on my knees and pray for it you on the other hand you have something to live for no  she’s beautiful isn’t she you should have seen her before flawless and still so innocent not such a whore in bed
who is it
not many people in this world have that kind of fortune
revenge isn’t so hard to fathom what’s clever is getting someone else to pay for it
indeed
i see my friend davidov ran into some difficulty
he died before he could complete his lifelong dream  i intend to finish it for him
i’m sorry
he was my father
you knew him well
a word i’m sure by now he’s engineered a hostile takeover
perhaps sir robert had a word with the man upstairs
today of all days the sun decides to shine
yes
beautiful isn’t it
oh james
one last screw
elektra it’s not too late  eight million people needn’t die
know what happens when a man is strangled
noone will believe this meltdown was an accident
it runs in my veins thicker than blood i’m going to redraw the map and when i am through the whole world will know my name my grandfather’s name the glory of my people
it is my oil  mine and my family’s
was this all about the oil
he killed me he killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom
so you killed your father
just like youonly you were even easier
you turned renard
since i was a child i’ve always had a power over men when i realized my father wouldn’t rescue me from the kidnappers i knew i had to form a new alliance
five more turns and your neck will break
all this because you fell for renard
soon she’ll be everywhere
where’s m
not interested
i could have given you the world
you do what you have to do but i’ve called in m  she’s en route from london even now
i’m coming with you
you knew  you knew all the time that he was out there that he was coming for me and you lied you used me you used me as bait you made love to me  what to pass the time as you waited for him to strike
he used your exact words
how dare you  how dare you that animal  that monster he disgusts me you disgust me  so he knew where to hurt you is that it you had a sling on your arm at the funeral i didn’t have to sleep with you to find that out
i think you do
i don’t know what you’re talking about
you can drop the act it’s over
are you sayingrenard is the man who’s trying to kill me
we had a runin he and i he knew about us he knew about my shoulder he knew exactly where to hurt me
what
or did you steal it from your old friend renard
what are you talking about
a little does it matter after all what’s the point of living if you can’t feel alive  isn’t that right elektra isn’t that your motto
what’s wrong with you  are you crazy
i used my body on the guards  it gave me control i got to a gun and i took my chance  i’ve never told anyone that
how did you survive
shush
you knew when you first saw me  you knew it would be like this
not at that price time to surrender
surely you believe in living dangerously
really
i understand it’s normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end
you had your chance james now i’m looking for a bigger thrill
if this little show is for my benefit i’ll take you home right now
someone wants to kill me i’d rather die looking him straight in the eye  what are you doing here  looking for a woman a little more your type how about that one
what the hell are you doing here
two shaken not stirred
vodka martini
i have to go to work
i don’t want to be safe
no you’ll be safe here
then take me with you
i have to go
james
you should rest
what is it
i think you’re one of the bravest people i’ve ever met
the way i acted in the snowyou must think i’m a coward
i know
i can’t stay
it’s the only way out
no  it will cave in
you’re not going to
i can’t stay here
we’re alright
oh my godwe’re buried alive
no
you don’t take no for an answer do you
always wanted to see the upper lines
i have to check the upper lines  gabor will drive you back
you are wrong mr bond in fact i am the only person who can do it
i think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone especially king’s daughter
that’s every man within a five mile radius  including you  that’s why you’re here isn’t it you think i can’t do it you think i’m going to screw up or get myself killed
the killer doesn’t want to see this pipeline continue doesn’t want to see you take over
if you’ve come here to look after me mr bond thank you but no thank you  i have two bodyguards i don’t need a third
it’s not the pin your father wore it’s an exact duplicate inside is a tiny electrical detonator we have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice someone who worked at this company
are you trying to break my heart or is it just your way with women
it’s my father’s pin he wore it everyday of his life
does this look familiar to you
since the kidnapping why do you ask
how long has he been with you
my bodyguard he follows me everywhere he’s decisive vigilant  and he makes an excellent omelette
who is he
partially yes
is that why you want to finish the pipeline
god no all those horrible loved ones and relatives i don’t want to talk to those people i just want totalk to my father  i loved him  i’m not sure he knew that
funerals aren’t exactly memorable
i haven’t been able to recall a single moment of that dayuntil now
yes
i met you at my father’s funeral
i’d heard there were some renovations thereno one would look for a sub in that place in a million years
how appropriate
the maiden’s tower
the right kind of explosion in the right spot  it would block the bosphorus cut off the black sea
mother of god
istanbul
where
so  my way  no mi6 no interpol  just you me and my people
this is a family matter if my nephew is in danger we do it my way or nothing now get me out
this is too big for even you  where is it
no  get me out
where’s the sub going
a special job  aaa submarine
and the payoff on the tables
alright alright  sometimes i smuggle machinery for her  russian stuff
no  the truth  she thought i was dead  those blades were meant for you  what do you know that she would kill you for
a rope
nowwhere were we
you are out of your league  she’s working with renard
that is 5000 dollars of beluga ruined
as ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks
she dropped a million and half dollars to the house  your house and you didn’t even bat an eyelid  she was paying you off  what for
i thought you were the one in her business
what’s your business with elektra king
really bond couldn’t you find a nice russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears
ah i see  a purelyplutonic relationship
she’s no innocent  this is my nuclear consultant
what are doing bond  trying to impress this innocent thing
but you would have something to gain by killing robert king and stopping his pipeline
bond if someone wants you dead it is renard our government has nothing to gain by killing you
how high up does thisarms dealing go
that too everyone does what they can to survive
off a highpowered paraski that was trying to kill me
where did you get this
if i remember my cyrillic that says 101st airborne division
what  this is not possible
how does a terrorist like renard supply his men with stateoftheart russian army weapons
see  you’re upsetting my customers what do you want
have some of the rat’s nest caviar  from my own fishery  they buy my caviar drink my champagne lose to my house
mafia warlords diplomats and spies consortiums from every country in the world  a nice little rat’s nest
bond i’m a civilian this is my place used to be the royal family’s now it’s mine i run my little business i stay out of trouble
you of course i need some information
bondjamesbond what brings you here
valentin zukovsky
cclass
what class sub does your nephew run
in the good old days the kgb had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing but yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo
former kgb surveillance post the dye factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit
what is this place
bond
no bond
to haul some cargo my nephew he is captain of a sub in the black sea fleet
what
who  bond  bond is dead
someone will come
now you know how it feels  to be locked away to wonder if they’re coming for you if anyone will ever come for you
is nothing  his kingdom he stole from my mother the kingdom i will rightly take back
your father
your people your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me you and my father he didn’t think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market
please
perhaps this isn’t the time
couldcould you come
i’ll send someone out
yes  au revoir
everything’s under control up here  are you ready
no  it is the beginning the world will never be the same

why are you like this  because bond is dead  it’s what you wanted
how would you know
so beautiful so smooth so warm
is it
warm
still no contact yet
any word from him
where it can do the most damage
it’s heading for the oil terminal
the parcel’s in the post
marvellous
anywhere in this circle  iran iraq pakistan syria afghanistan
do we have the range of renard’s plane
and expensive  cost three million plus
we’ve been pawns in someone’s game they tricked us into bringing the money to king not just elaborate  cocksure

thanks no  but its a wonderful product  now adrian  your old colleague dr manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors 
sphinx brand  when i got out of weapons design i wanted to move into a more    humanitarian area  i was thinking: what would do some good in the world  and i thought: why not a geneticallyaltered tobacco that no only doesnt cause cancer  but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it  in fact i think ill have one now  care to join me
thats right  your meal tickets flown the coop  that blue bastard has apparently left the planet
jon  you mean hes 
oh i am honey  you see russian tanks are crossing the afghan border this very minute  and we are all of us every living soul in deep deep shit  because our numberone strategic weapons has finally flipped out

jesus christ gibbons this is something we came up with
silent night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent the glass canister is shot into the air and detonated the black and white chemicals mix forming a toxic cloud when it settles down to earth itll kill everything in the vicinity
come on gibbons you can do better then that
yes it does
they retrofitted ahab with some kind of rocket launcher they were loading canisters of liquid into it light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate something tells me this it that classified stuff you didnt want me to know about does the song silent night mean anything to you

hey one miracle at a time theyre on to me now remember
this is good work x damn fine work you need to press on at all costs find out what they have planned with this ahab
yeah i sent you pictures heres what im thinking if they take out the cameras and sensors they could probably put a bomb in this thing you drop it in the water in the red sea and three weeks later its swimming up the potomac
you did say ahab youre sure about that
i know poison needles in my shins youve got 36 hours peace out
my friend if youre planning on crossing me

that information is classified youre there to gather information on their operations period
what the hell am i after youre telling me dick
were not after car thieves here
im already on a first name basis with these dudes i got a deal set up you want me to hammer it or not
one point two million dollars i did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars
buddy you sent me here to get close to their organization that costs money
if youre trying to push my buttons youre on the right track dont make me question my own judgment x
i guess you got my email i set up a purchase ten cars
just remember ill be watching
is that all
crude and defiant as always triple x it fits so well because youre obscene
up yours
fine but im not gonna be no bulldog omega 5
i expect you to call in regularly with progress reports
yeah i spy or i die
wherever you go on the planet ill find you theres no quitting if you try to take it off a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground is all that clear
how about a pedicure as long as youre down there whats this lojack
whats with that x on the back of your head does that mean youre extreme ive got some news for you mr x youre a three time loser so maybe you should tattoo another couple of xs on your head
not bad for a gimp
youre one sick bastard a sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission i think no matter which way i go im likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic so heres my answer: kiss my ass hopalong
if you find out what i want to know and if im able to successfully use that information you get to go back to your degenerate little life if not you take a bath
what do i get out of it
theres some folks i want to keep tabs on dirty tattooed uncivilized your kind of people
now im the one whos nauseous so whats the deal what do you need me for
thats too bad i thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge
i plan on getting a lot older and playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead
youre an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary you risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and youre not getting any younger
im not interested ive already got a job
youre perceptive too i forgot to add that to the list of surprises im with the national security agency and unlikely as it may sound i need your help
you want the cheap backstory the runaway mom the suicide dad and the foster homes gimme a break youre not interested in my past youre interested in my future as some kind of spy
youve really got me confused cage on the one hand you showed leadership courage under fire a willingness to protect men you hardly knew and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic help me out here im not following your evolution
good thing you were there to save the day come walk with me
youre a cold piece of work you almost got three people killed out there
congratulations youve just graduated at the head of your class
you know what i hate its always the assholes that pass the tests
you know what i hate any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think theyre god
sure as gravity ive had a feeling about you from the start cage its nausea
is that a fact
youve got this wrong youre not under arrest youve been abducted and until i say different you belong to me
are we done now youve got nothing on me so if you aint booking me im walking
oh i dont know i think the tests work pretty well sometimes they give me answers you wouldnt admit to in a million years
look at me dude do i look like a fan of law enforcement forget the tests you shoulda just asked me i woulda saved you a lot of trouble
why is that
if youre trolling around for narcs man have you got the wrong guy
alright cage youve got me this is one of those moments many are called few are chosen that kind of thing your government needs you are you up for the challenge
a fed i shoulda known who else would have this kind of budget now youre gonna hit me with the sales pitch
its your lucky day you just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy
good for you now why dont you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want you didnt go through all this for my benefit
whether you thought this was for real or not you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct that tells me something about your character
that shows me already that you dont have a clue whats it to you anyway
most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place i expected you to do the same
diner huh let me tell you what the problem is i wake up drugged to find what youve got a salesman over here reading a three week old newspaper hes pulling a 211 with a trucker who happens to be packing a cop issue h&k 9mm i get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note hows that for twisted logic how did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before i walked in and if thats true whyd they stop and wait until i woke up to gaffle the money then i notice how beefy they both are hell even the waitress is cut all three of them look like they went through the same training program ergo they aint strangers and this isnt what it seems thats how i knew yoyo wouldnt get a round off even if i gave him all day why
looks like a diner
what is this place
the names gibbons you were saying
who the hell are you
so the odds are up to fiftyfifty i can deal with that
alright do what you want but keep the screws on him hes a wild card that could be either good or bad
why not you were going to throw him in a tub full of acid werent you
hes gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined he got us an account number to boot now even if hes just dumb and lucky i say we back his play  i put him out there sam if he doesnt come up with the money theyll kill him i cant let that happen
youre talking about a very expensive risk here
if it means getting silent night back absolutely
you what a wire transfer of this size
i think we should send him whatever he wants
ridiculous cut him off im sorry gibbons you pulled up a shark this time
thats exactly why we need them
theyre degenerates theres not a man in there that would give a damn if the chinese took over
ive seen enough turn it off
but programmable and expendable
the scum of the earth
the usual prospects convicts contract killers murde
you wanna find out about rats ask a rat ive had my people put together a talent pool i downloaded it to your desktop
so youll dredge the bottom again youve done that before the results were uneven
ill go in with a team but first im going to need some intel ill have to put someone inside someone new someone they wont see coming one of their own
how will you fix it
were gonna have to step in sam those cia boys couldnt find a clown in a field of cactus let me take care of it
silent night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
theyre ruthless and they have a lot of firepower its only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy silent night then were gonna have a catastrophe on our hands
he was the best there was that makes three agents lost
not a whole helluva lot his final transmission was mangled about something or someone called ahab whatever it is it cost him his life
what do you have

yorgi masterminded the takeover of three red mafiya clans cops called it blood week he combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: anarchy 99
kirill the sniper looks like a bookworm but he had 72 confirmed kills in chechnya they called him the finger of god assassination and weapons

you cant welch on me now we had a deal
i cant believe my mission is finally over i dont even know what to do with myself
use your grenades maybe we can blow it up underwater
by then its too late the only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water the chemicals will break down and dissipate
it has to surface to release the nerve agent right
its running three meters down twenty knots
a manual control on a moving torpedo this day keeps getting better and better

i know where hes coming from the only thing i really dont get is why he dumped you up until i found that out i thought his judgment was pretty sound
you agree with a lot of what he says dont you
dont judge a comic book by its cover
whoever sent you knew what they were doing you and yorgi are practically twins two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but dont say much

you both could have been a part of it you could have ridden with us into a new day the dawning of a new age of 
come on xander you used to stand for something what happened to you man i thought youd get it
and here i thought anarchy was just something cool to put on a tshirt
sure if thats what you want why not its all human nature so we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it
including rape pillage murder
easier than that buddy ill get them to destroy each other you kill an entire peace conference someone is going to have to pay then our friend ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour london cairo beijing pretty soon everyones involved these guys bomb those guys those guys invade these guys soon the whole world is like your wild west cowboy days no rules no law everybody free to do what they want
so all by yourself youre going to destroy every government; in the world
you think im after money i told you my friend anarchy time for a change money is good but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves
whats the gimmick yorgi thats the part i dont get you gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs i didnt think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche
not bad man not bad you put things together quick prague it is
i wanted to get the hell out of prague before silent night falls

try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese anarchy burger by the vandals
to us it means no walls no speed limits no jails its everybody does what he wants people think democracy is freedom but they dont have a clue theres an old punk song it says: america stands for freedom but if you think youre free
thats what im talking about man thats why anarchy 99 was born
screw the world if im gonna die for something it better be bitches and money

he flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink
cops like a plague no matter how many you pay theres always another with his hand out how did you pick him out
who you workin for what do you do for a living dickhead
this pizda never seen him before
thats the guy
beast
storm  try to look for the highest vantage point from what i can figure hell need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island  it is my feeling that magneto has to
we all do
i wish i could go
 until he found tungsten
thomas edison knew how to make the light bulb  he had the energy source he had the vacuum  but he didnt have the filament  he tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power
the neurofilter acts like a surge protector regulating the infinite flow of information from cerebro to the professors mind  its what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions
what does that mean
so where do you think hes planning this larger demonstration
yes  only theres a problem  the mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature  its forcing the bodys cells to replicate thousands of times faster than theyre accustomed to  the senators body is literally burning itself out  scott  this machine kills people and i dont think magneto realizes it
for what purpose
correct  apparently adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces  he used the adamantium in logans dog tag to test it on the senator  and i assume now he plans to use the rest of logans skeleton for a larger demonstration
its core
it appears as though magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings and he is using adamantium as its core
im afraid without cerebros help he wont have the strength to heal himself  and without the neuro filter theres no cerebro
can the professor repair his own mind
im sorry  im not strong enough
jean can you
storm rogue  you take the south entrance  jean and i will go in here
its too far
im going to assume that means that the secret service is out of commission  jean can you raise me up there
uhhuh
into the hudson
radar stealth mode checks out  all right therell be less security north of the george washington bridge  im taking her down
he calls me sport one more time and ill blow a watermelonsized hole through him
whats that
ill tell you one thing though
well i think thats perfectly understandable
hey  im sorry  about logan  i was jealous
no  im  i dont know if we can do this without charles
are you all right
we have to find magneto
hes already losing control of his vitals  respiratory  cardiovascular unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning im afraid
his vital signs are weak and getting weaker
whats wrong with him
if magneto is planning to use logan for some terrible purpose its our responsibility to do something
you saw what happened tonight  you think magneto wont come after him again  you think he wont come here if necessary  this is a school for gods sake
what are you talking about
i dont like him being here
scott i 
sure you are sport
im ok  im ok
shut up  i got no interest in you xavier  or your xmen
you know you 
ive served with men like you before methodical  systematic  naive  you know what happens to those men in a real fight
i dont remember  is that what you wanted to ask me
how long have you been in alaska
i wanted to talk to you
inspiring  now what am i doing here
yeah ill bet you have
ive seen a lot of rings
logan do you see this ring
what is it youre failing to get at are you interested in me
he takes himself seriously
he takes his work seriously
hes uptight
suit yourself
let go
not interested
what do you say
were you now
i was thinking maybe you and me could go into town
hes busy right now
you should always work with a spotter
what if theyre naughty
if necessary
by reading my thoughts
maybe the professor could help you with that
yeah  well i dont like to talk about my past
the professor said you were a solider actually i believe he used the word mercenary
what if i like the pain
ill see what i can do  you should get some sleep  even with your healing ability youre going to be hurting for a while
i wont light the cigars  how about that
theres no smoking or drinking on the school grounds
some cigars  case of beer
anything else i can get you
i can assure you there is no such creature in my genes
the mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change
tell it to the ones that did this to me
treat you like a mutant  we are not what you think  not all of us
im sorry to come here ms grey  i was afraid if i went to a hospital they would
senator
dr grey
i can assure you there is no such creature in my genes
i presume nothing i am here to tell you that in time the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet  perhaps even your children senator
this was taken by a state police officer in secaucus new jersey  a man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him  i dont know where you come from ms grey but where i come from you dont go melting peoples cars when they cut you off  you do it the old fashioned way  you give em the finger  but what you presume to tell this committee 
control senator  we teach them control
you wouldnt happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to 
math  history  science  english athletics 
ms grey  you work at a school for mutants in westchester new york  can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants
i am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded senator  the wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous
youre avoiding the question i posed to you at the beginning of the hearing ms grey  three words: are mutants dangerous
lets just say god works too slowly
what is it you intend to do to me
intention  intention senator  we are talking about mankind here  his fear  it is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps  studied for weaknesses  and eventually wiped off the face of the earth
the intention of registration act 
gosh i hope so
whatever you do to me no matter what youll make me right  every word i have spoken will be confirmed
you mutant bastards
mr guyrich has been dead for some time senator
you wha who are you where is henry
in the road to survival there is always sacrifice logan  we are the future not them  we must protect ourselves  after tonight when the leaders of the world return home  they will return as brothers as mutants and our cause will be theirs  this is survival i know you understand that logan or is it wolverine
what are you going to do
youre backstage at the encore of creation
where am i
you think i care about her  im the only one whos sure to walk out of here
come with me and ill let her live
what do you want
i do love a good check mate
what miss me  charley im gonna walk out the front door and trust me it wont be soon enough for everyone here
why  you have a home here now if you want it  everyone will
actually im feeling up to leaving
theyre all asking how youre doing are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone
dont you knock
ill go
ive found her westchester mall
we were friends once  but that was a long time ago
he helped you
actually magneto helped me put it together
you designed this yourself
the brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being
how
to find rogue
where are we going
i believe he wants you for your adamantium
no  thats me talking  and you know what  its only been thirtytwo hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me
now thats magneto talking
what if it never happens  what if theyre so afraid of us that we become the enemy  this place is gonna be one giant cemetery
the point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility  to recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings
this  this whole god damn thing  making yourselves into some sort of team of superpowered freaks teaching wayward mutants about classical literature  for what
the point of what
deal
fortyeight hours old man  but if you cross me i wont feel any guilt about what i do to you
a very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you im not sure why but until we find out i must ask you to stay
who
i brought you here so that you would be safe from magneto
what am i doing here
and you think it helps calling her rogue
if she held on any longer she could have
i felt like she almost killed me
she borrowed your power to save her life  when she touches someone she absorbs their strengths  their gifts  in your case  your ability to heal  thats why she keeps her body covered
what did she do to me
the sun is setting logan  youve been asleep for nineteen hours
why is everybody up at sunrise
alive
ill find him
enough for a test
is it enough
a piece  only a piece
is that what youre looking for
it was xaviers people  they knew
how
i lost him
i feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble
and what do you do when you wake up to that
it does indeed max
doesnt it ever wake you in the middle of the night  the feeling that some day some day very soon they will pass that foolish law  or one just like it  and they will come for you and your children  take you all away
i know
i wouldnt really have let you die you know  i just needed
what do you mean to do
this checkmate goes to you  i didnt want to hurt anyone  but you leave me no choice
what do you mean to do
im going to change the world with or without you as a witness charles  and this one gets a front row seat
the way what is going to be
if i could make you understand  if you could just be made to see it the way i do  the way its going to be
lets just say that i am out to make some radical changes  now come on charles  for old times sake for your sake  leave him to me
you definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me max what is it like these days
still trying to make the world safe for our kind  still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves  definitively
is that so
what do you want with him
the two in alaska  just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time  still tinkering with cerebro
not at the cost of lives max
i am trying to save our kind charles you should do the same
and ill never understand terrorists
ill never understand your regard for them charles
herr falkstein  you must go at once and present dr frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance  the estate will provide for your journey

darling you mustnt worry so
poor delbruck  there must be some way to reach him  to control that body

surely he kept his notes  his private papers and records in some other place
this is the only library i know of
well there was a public and a private library  he said so in his will  these books are all very general  any doctor might have them in his study
i dont know what you mean sir

there seem to be quite a few books
may i have it please

the old violinist  you smashed his violin over your knee
i didnt do that
break that old mans violin
what
why did you do that
well if youre sure that i could accomplish everything in a week i suppose i could manage it
ill have to think it over  its not so easy just to pick up and
a week  ten days at most
how long will this whole thing take
do you have a hundred thousand of them sir
but i cant just drop everything and leave  i have responsibilities and obligations
oh at least sir  the land alone is worth a small fortune
my name is gerhart falkstein
fron kon steen
dr frankenstein
my grandfathers work was doodoo dead is dead  theres only one thing i am interested in and that is the preservation of life
but your grandfathers work sir
you have more chance of reanimating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system
i am a scientist  not a philosopher
but sir
hearts and kidneys are tinker toys im talking about the central nervous system
but look at whats been done with hearts and kidneys
nineteen  my dear young man once the human organism has ceased to function nature has deemed that creature to be dead
nineteen sir
how old are you young man
yes but sir if it could be accomplished wouldnt that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death
you are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind
but arent you the least bit curious about it doctor  doesnt the secret of life hold any intrigue for you
my father was a sick man
but wasnt that the whole basis of your grandfathers work sir the reanimation of component parts
are you speaking of the worm or  the spaghetti
vermicelli
a piece of what
isnt it true that darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until by some extraordinary means it actually began to move with voluntary motion
yes
dr fronkonsteen
in conclusion it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious because once a nerve fibber is severed there is no way to regenerate life back into it  are there any more questions before we leave
very good  since our lab work today is a demonstration of just that distinction why dont we proceed
well sir im not sure i understand the distinction between reflexive and voluntary nerve impulses
i prefer by far to be remembered for my own small contributions to science  now if we can proceed to your questions
thats true  but my grandfather victor was after all what we might politely refer to as a cuckoo
but arent you the grandson of the famous dr victor frankenstein who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism
no its dr fronkonsteen
oh  i thought it was dr frankenstein
my name is pronounced fron kon steen
i beg your pardon
thats fronkonsteen
okay boss  but i hope you know what youre doing
its the only way
yes master  are you sure you want to go through with it

ill bet its a doozy
theres only one way
i like your style master  how do we get him here
 and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid

hes carrying her off now through the woods

dilation of his sacral parasympathetic impulses would cause an increase in flow of blood and the erection to approximately nineteen inches of his apparatus genitals
and look at this doctor
as the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed i resolved to make the creature of a gigantic stature of course  that would simplify everything

im sorry sir  we only seat by reservation
food
do you have a reservation
food
yes sir name please
zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don t mean to say they got no brains theyll watch us  and wait  and find our weaknesses
why don t the zulus attack
one zulu is only one man and im afeared of no one man but the zulu they come in the thousands like a black wave of death in the thousands and them assegais stabbing
you afeared of the zulus then quartermaster
could be  across the river into zululand  they might just be waiting there for us to show up them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies
will we be fighting the zulus soo~ quartermaster 
so you got it in the line of dooty  point taken
from the cook sir they saw me dip your shaving tin in the teawater this morning made their tea taste of lifebuoy toilet soap they saij handing him the bottle of gin he purloined earlier 2t
i listened extra careful to your stand to this mornin boy ft was peifecl i couldnt ve done it better meseif not even when i was bugler to the duke of wellington now tell me where did you get that black eye
will you hear last post sir
our friend colonel dumford will be  should be   at this minute approaching pulleine i think well eat here i want to scout that mountain top and be back with an appetite in one hour 
eleven oclock my lorj 42
what oclock is it mr noggs
my only fear is that the zulu will avoid the engagement
so attack is your defence well lets hope cetshwayo will offer his impis full destruction
do not confuse yourse{fi why we must strike a heavy blow this cannot be a war of manoeuvre
if ive got it right my lord you lead an invasion into zululand for i see it all around me but why is the question my readers will ask why
tell what you see write it well sir and make sure you get it right
they spurred onto high ground my lord full of spirit and looking for the zulu full of sport they were my lord
were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory
indeedldid mylord itwas one ofthe first to cross
1 saw you lead our cavalry sir
excuse me my lord  norrisnewman of the standard my lord
an historical moment gentlemen
and the threat of counter invasion no longer exists 40
tomorrow we will continue our advance on ulundi dumford kindly return to your unit bring them here immediately to support pulleine mr vereker will join you as adc do you understand me clearly
im explaining my reasons
are you dictating the strategy of this war sir
intelligence sources of your own did it not occur to you they may be native rumours rumours to draw you off to leave the whole ofnatal open to a possible counter thrust
i have received intelligence from sources of my own that the zulu impis are moving north of here and threaten your left
you intended to bring your reserves across the river
my lord  this list was prepared for you i don t think another can understand its true value
excellent thank you  give them to crealock would you
i thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks zulu
oh indeed crealock we should see that colonel dumford has an officer for his hard riders perhaps a subaltern from the twenty fourth
they come well recommended do they durnford
sikali horse my lord christians all i know each one by name
splendid horsemanship  who are they
certainly sin
splendid site crealock splendil i want to establish camp here immediately
a large party of zulus have been sighted in the direction of the kings kraal getting up chelmsford moves over to look at the map on his desk
yes
thank you
the only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the royal kraal at ulundi
our runners bare his dispatches do they not
er called noggs sir actual name is norrisnewman he presented credentials from the standard
whats that strange name the newspaper chaps called
but will they make good use of them
yes i see youve issued each of them with a martini henry carbine our quota for native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle
right  bombardier to me please
well fed or hungry pulleine wants them in position immediately 
well my horses are feeding as you may observe mr coghill itll take a little while
how quickly can you move your artillery forward
yes
stuart
keep steady youre the best shots of the twentyfourth you bunch of heathens do it
choose your targets men thats right watch those markers 55
ft could be you flatter yourself coghill its that odd eye
well that one the one who keeps looking at me
which one
do you think she might be interested in  someone
well thats typical of her majestys army appoint an engineer to do a soldiers work
um there are rumours that my lord chelmsford intends to make durnford second in command
lighting coghill 5 cigar: our good colonel dumford scored quite a coup with the sikali horse
so far only their scouts but we have had reports of a small impi farther north over there 
and i assure you you do not in fact id be obliged for your best advice what have your scouts seen
well i assure you sir i have no desire to create difficulties 45
i think chelmsford wants a good man on the border why he fears a flanking attack and requires a steady commander in reserve
lord chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my basutos
im to take the sikali with the main column to the river
your orders mr vereker
good ones yes mr vereker gentlemen who can ride and shoot
colonel durnford william vereker i hear you ve been seeking officers
