there is always a way but you are such a a glotzkopp you cannot see youd rather go back to that city to nothing no woman no children no land
oh come on rachel no way
im not so sure of anything as you are john book you could live this life if you wanted to bad enough  just as i could live yours
arent you after today
youre so sure of that
no  i was being unrealistic even thinking about living this life
i was being foolish
i know
there was a time when i would have welcomed it
there was
there was a time when i thought you might have stayed
im leaving tonight  im going to need my clothes and my gun
you should not bother with that birdhouse  if youre leaving tomorrow
i see  but i hope you have a lot of sugar  eli is ready to go to zooks

im sorry im sure it is
now hold on theres a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job
whacking is not of much use on a farm
i can whack people im hell at whacking
what else can you do
i did some carpentry summers when i was going to school
you know carpentry
a real fireball
we had some lemonade and he left
oh  what happened to hochstetler
eli is a fine carpenter best in the district he and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago
oh the bullets
the bullets
you can go with eli hes taking samuel to school but youll have to hurry
i know what he said
but stoltzfus said
im going this morning
well the store at saltzburg  but you wont be going to saltzburg for a while
no id want a public phone

anything against zippers
vain proud such a person is hochmutsnarr he is not plain
hochmut
buttons are hochmut
something wrong with buttons
i should tell you these do not have buttons  see hooks and eyes
yes its good that someone can have the use of them besides in your clothes youd stand out to strangers
your husbands
your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood i have them soakingyou can wear these
very interesting im learning a lot about manure  whats that
enjoying your reading
its not the gun dont you understand its you what you stand for  that is not for samuel
nobody meant any harm the boy was curious i unloaded the gun 
john book i would appreciate it if during the time you are with us you would have as little to do with samuel as possible
you tell him when youre able
tell him his tea stinks
but you cant
listen thank you thanks for everything but ive got to go
two days
how long have i been here
what
how long
only the elders
does anybody know im here
can i have something to drink
the leadership of our district the diener bishop tschantz is the one with no hair on top they decided to come and see you for themselves except stoltzfus of course he came the first day i think he saved your life
who are they
but –
gunshot theyll file reports theyll find me
but why
no no doctor
but john why didnt you go to a hospital
what about samuel will you come back to take him to trial
i cant
stay for awhile rest ill make coffee and breakfast
i was wrong
you said we would be safe in philadelphia
you couldnt wait until morning
home
where are you taking us now
youll be safe you dont have to worry
im afraid im afraid for samuel i want to go home
because – somehow – they knew i was getting close  look its narcotics they make dope out of chemicals they sell it on the street for millions of dollars theyll do anything  and they can get away with it because theyre cops
but why would they murder
listen im the cop that polices the police im not in the business of protecting crooked cops  ill make an arrest when i know everybody involved
why dont you arrest that man are you protecting him because policeman
oh yes she thinks you like policing because you think youre right about everything and youre the only one who can do anything and that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a um bag of elbows
oh anything else
she thinks you should get married and have children of your own instead of trying to be a father to hers except she thinks youre afraid of the responsibility
no
your sister said you dont have a family
whats a good tired tired is tired
but not a good tired
i would not be too sure
they kid a lot
no youre not –  youre glad because now youve got a witness  i heard the other police talking last night  they dont seem to like you very much
look im genuinely sorry
people who dont go into our courts when theyre told to sometimes go directly into our jail
we do not go into your courts
believe me im trying to get this over with as fast as i can but samuel will probably have to come back and testify
yes and i also want to leave this city
whacking
the problem is i dont happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people
now whats the problem
he wants to know who you are your name i told him we dont need to know anything about you
what was that
its not a joke
doesnt surprise me i meet a lot of people like that
you dont understand we have nothing to do with your laws
yes i do your son is a material witness to a homicide
you have no right to keep us here
were looking for a suspect weve reason to believe hes still in the area
where are you taking us
therell be another train  the man who was killed tonight was a policeman sam its my job to find out who did it i want you to tell me everything you saw when you went in there
samuel samuel lapp  but what happened here is none of his affair my sister is expecting me our train is leaving soon
im a police officer im going to have to talk to the boy whats his name

elaine i dont want to have to take you in for questioning youve got his car you were the last to see him –
better you should get off my front porch before i get my mace

he accused john of taking kickbacks and you know – anybody who knows john – knows thats a goddamn lie
elaine ive come to apologize for lt mcelroy he overstated the departments position
not yet
did you find him
listen i dont know whats going on or how you got mixed up with him but dont you let that selfrighteous son of a bitch push you around okay

well you cant  as for you my fine friend  youre a victim of disorganized thinking  you are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger you have no courage  youre confusing courage with wisdom  back where i come from we have men who are called heroes  once a year they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city  and they have no more courage than you have  but they have one thing that you havent got a medal  therefore  for meritorious
how can i ever thank you enough
thd
therefore by virtue of the authority vested in me by the universitatus committeeatum e plurbis unum i hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of thd
you promised us real things  a real
well

 ruined my exit
oh  help me the balloons going up
this is a highly irregular procedure this is absolutely unprecedented
stop that dog
yes  
but i still want one
as for you my galvanized friend you want a heart you dont know how lucky you are not to have one hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable i could have been a world figure a power among men a  a successful wizard had i not been obstructed by a heart
